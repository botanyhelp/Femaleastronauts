<string name="Valentina_Tereshkova">Valentina Vladimirovna Tereshkova (Russian: Валенти́на Влади́мировна Терешко́ва; born 6 March 1937) is a retired Soviet cosmonaut and engineer, and the first woman to have flown in space, having been selected from more than four hundred applicants and five finalists to pilot Vostok 6 on 16 June 1963. In order to join the Cosmonaut Corps, Tereshkova was only honorarily inducted into the Soviet Air Force and thus she also became the first civilian to fly in space.[1]\n\nBefore her recruitment as a cosmonaut, Tereshkova was a textile factory assembly worker and an amateur skydiver. After the dissolution of the first group of female cosmonauts in 1969, she became a prominent member of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, holding various political offices. She remained politically active following the collapse of the Soviet Union and is still revered as a heroine in post&#8211;Soviet Russia.\n\nIn 2013 she offered to go on a one&#8211;way trip to Mars if the opportunity arose.[2] At the opening ceremony of the 2014 Winter Olympics she was a flag&#8211;carrier of the Olympic flag.\n\nContents  [hide] \n1 Early life\n2 Career in the Soviet space program\n3 Education\n4 Prominence in Soviet politics\n5 Personal life\n6 Honours and awards\n7 See also\n8 References\n9 External links\nEarly life\nTereshkova was born in the village Maslennikovo, Tutayevsky District, Yaroslavl Oblast, in central Russia. Her parents had migrated from Belarus.[3] Tereshkova\'s father was a tractor driver and her mother worked in a textile plant. Tereshkova began school in 1945 at the age of eight, but left school in 1953 and continued her education by correspondence courses.[4] She became interested in parachuting from a young age, and trained in skydiving at the local Aeroclub, making her first jump at age 22 on 21 May 1959; at the time, she was employed as a textile worker in a local factory. It was her expertise in skydiving that led to her selection as a cosmonaut. In 1961 she became the secretary of the local Komsomol (Young Communist League) and later joined the Communist Party of the Soviet Union.\n\nCareer in the Soviet space program\n\nThis biographical article needs additional citations for verification. Please help by adding reliable sources. Contentious material about living persons that is unsourced or poorly sourced must be removed immediately, especially if potentially libelous or harmful. (November 2010)\n\n\nCosmonauts Valentina Tereshkova and Valery Bykovsky among children\nAfter the flight of Yuri Gagarin in 1961, Sergey Korolyov, the chief Soviet rocket engineer, came up with the idea of putting a woman in space. On 16 February 1962, Valentina Tereshkova was selected to join the female cosmonaut corps. Out of more than four hundred applicants, five were selected: Tatyana Kuznetsova, Irina Solovyova, Zhanna Yorkina, Valentina Ponomaryova, and Tereshkova. Qualifications included that they be parachutists under 30 years of age, under 170 cm (5 feet 7 inches) tall, and under 70 kg (154 lbs.) in weight.\n\nTereshkova was considered a particularly worthy candidate, partly due to her \"proletarian\" background, and because her father, tank leader sergeant Vladimir Tereshkov, was a war hero. He died in the Finnish Winter War during World War II in the Lemetti area in Finnish Karelia when Tereshkova was two years old. After her mission she was asked how the Soviet Union should thank her for her service to the country. Tereshkova asked that the government search for, and publish, the location where her father was killed in action. This was done, and a monument now stands at the site in Lemetti—now on the Russian side of the border. Tereshkova has since visited Finland several times.\n\nTraining included weightless flights, isolation tests, centrifuge tests, rocket theory, spacecraft engineering, 120 parachute jumps and pilot training in MiG&#8211;15UTI jet fighters. The group spent several months in intensive training, concluding with examinations in November 1962, after which four remaining candidates were commissioned Junior Lieutenants in the Soviet Air Force. Tereshkova, Solovyova and Ponomaryova were the leading candidates, and a joint mission profile was developed that would see two women launched into space, on solo Vostok flights on consecutive days in March or April 1963.\n\n\n\nCosmonauts Andriyan Nikolayev and Valentina Tereshkova on a Hungarian stamp.\nOriginally it was intended that Tereshkova would launch first in Vostok 5 while Ponomaryova would follow her into orbit in Vostok 6. However, this flight plan was altered in March 1963. Vostok 5 would now carry a male cosmonaut Valery Bykovsky flying the joint mission with a woman aboard Vostok 6 in June 1963. The State Space Commission nominated Tereshkova to pilot Vostok 6 at their meeting on 21 May and this was confirmed by Nikita Khrushchev himself. Tereshkova was exactly ten years younger than the youngest Mercury Seven astronaut, Gordon Cooper.\n\nAfter watching the successful launch of Vostok 5 on 14 June, Tereshkova began final preparations for her own flight. She was 26 at the time. On the morning of 16 June 1963, Tereshkova and her back&#8211;up Solovyova were both dressed in spacesuits and taken to the launch pad by bus. After completing her communication and life support checks, she was sealed inside the Vostok. After a two&#8211;hour countdown, Vostok 6 launched faultlessly, and Tereshkova became the first woman in space. Her call sign in this flight was Chaika (English: Seagull; Russian: Ча́йка), later commemorated as the name of an asteroid, 1671 Chaika.\n\n\n\nFrom right to left: Nikita Khrushchev, Valentina Tereshkova, Pavel Popovich and Yury Gagarin at the Lenin Mausoleum, during a celebration honoring the Soviet cosmonauts, 1963\nAlthough Tereshkova experienced nausea and physical discomfort for much of the flight,[5] she orbited the earth 48 times and spent almost three days in space. With a single flight, she logged more flight time than the combined times of all American astronauts who had flown before that date. Tereshkova also maintained a flight log and took photographs of the horizon, which were later used to identify aerosol layers within the atmosphere.\n\nVostok 6 was the final Vostok flight and was launched two days after Vostok 5 which carried Valery Bykovsky into a similar orbit for five days, landing three hours after Tereshkova. The two vessels approached each other within 5 kilometers (3.1 mi) at one point, and Tereshkova communicated with Bykovsky and with Khrushchev by radio.\n\nEven though there were plans for further flights by women, it took 19 years until the second woman, Svetlana Savitskaya, flew into space. None of the other four in Tereshkova\'s early group flew, and in October 1969 the pioneering female cosmonaut group was dissolved.\n\nEducation\n\n\nTereshkova, skiing, 1964\nAfter her flight, Tereshkova studied at the Zhukovsky Air Force Academy and graduated with distinction as a cosmonaut engineer. In 1977 she earned a doctorate in engineering.\n\nProminence in Soviet politics\nDue to her prominence Tereshkova was chosen for several political positions: from 1966 to 1974 she was a member of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union, from 1974 to 1989 a member of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet, and from 1969 to 1991 she was in the Central Committee of the Communist Party. In 1997 she was retired from the Russian Air Force and the cosmonaut corps by presidential order.\n\nBeyond her recognized political offices within the Soviet Union, Tereshkova also became a well known representative of the Soviet Union abroad. She was made a member of the World Peace Council in 1966, a member of the Yaroslavl Soviet in 1967, a member of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union in 1966&#8211;1970 and 1970&#8211;1974, and was elected to the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet in 1974. She was also the Soviet representative to the UN Conference for the International Women\'s Year in Mexico City in 1975. She also led the Soviet delegation to the World Conference on Women in Copenhagen and played a critical role in shaping the socialist women\'s global agenda for peace. She attained the rank of deputy to the Supreme Soviet, membership of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union Central Committee, Vice President of the International Woman’s Democratic Federation and President of the Soviet&#8211;Algerian Friendship Society.\n\nShe was decorated with the Hero of the Soviet Union medal, the USSR\'s highest award. She was also awarded the Order of Lenin, Order of the October Revolution, numerous other medals, and foreign orders including the Karl Marx Order, United Nations Gold Medal of Peace and the Simba International Women’s Movement Award. She was also bestowed a title of the Hero of Socialist Labor of Czechoslovakia, Hero of Labor of Vietnam, and Hero of Mongolia. In 1990 she received an honorary doctorate from the University of Edinburgh. Tereshkova crater on the far side of the Moon was named after her.\n\n\n\nTereshkova in 1970\nAfter the collapse of the Soviet Union, Tereshkova lost her political office but none of her prestige. To this day, she is revered as a heroine, and to some her importance in Russian space history is only surpassed by Yuri Gagarin and Alexey Leonov. In 2011, she was elected to the State Duma, the lower house of the Russian legislature, where she continues to serve.[6]\n\nTereshkova\'s life and spaceflight were first examined (in the west) in the 1975 book: It Is I, Sea Gull; Valentina Tereshkova, the first woman in space by Mitchel R. Sharpe[7] and then again in greater detail of her life and spaceflight in the 2007 book Into That Silent Sea by Colin Burgess and Francis French, including interviews with Tereshkova and her colleagues.\n\nTereshkova was invited to Prime Minister Vladimir Putin\'s residence in Novo&#8211;Ogaryovo for the celebration of her 70th birthday. While there she said that she would like to fly to Mars, even if it meant that it was a one way trip.[8]\n\nOn 5 April 2008, she became a torchbearer of the 2008 Summer Olympics torch relay in Saint Petersburg, Russia.[9]\n\nShe received the Eduard Rhein Ring of Honor from the German Eduard Rhein Foundation in 2007.[10][11]\n\nPersonal life\nAfter the Vostok 6 flight a rumour began circulating that she would marry Andriyan Nikolayev (1929&#8211;2004), the only bachelor cosmonaut to have flown. Nikolayev and Tereshkova married on 3 November 1963 at the Moscow Wedding Palace with Khrushchev himself presiding at the wedding party together with top government and space programme leaders.\n\nOn 8 June 1964, she gave birth to their daughter Elena Andrianovna Nikolaeva&#8211;Tereshkova,[12] who became a doctor and was the first person to have both a mother and father who had travelled into space. She and Nikolayev divorced in 1982. Her second husband, the orthopaedist Yuliy G. Shaposhnikov, died in 1999.\n\n\n\nThe wedding ceremony of pilot&#8211;cosmonauts Valentina Tereshkova and Andriyan Nikolayev, 3 November 1963.\nHonours and awards\n\n\nTereshkova at the Heureka science centre, in Finland, 2002\n\n\nValentina Tereshkova and Neil Armstrong, 1970\n\n\nTereshkova visiting the Lvov confectionary, 1967\n\n\nValentina Tereshkova among delegates of the 24th CPSU congress, 1971\n\n\nValentina Tereshkova and NASA astronaut Catherine Coleman at the Gagarin Cosmonaut Training Center in December 2010.\n\n\nTereshkova receives the Order of Friendship from Russian President Dmitry Medvedev on 12 April 2011 at the Moscow Kremlin.\nThis article incorporates information from the equivalent article on the Russian Wikipedia.\nRussian\nOrder of Alexander Nevsky (2013) [13]\nOrder of Merit for the Fatherland;\n2nd class (6 March 2007) &#8211;

While there she said that she would like to fly to Mars, even if it meant that it was a one way trip.[8]\n\nOn 5 April 2008, she became a torchbearer of the 2008 Summer Olympics torch relay in Saint Petersburg, Russia.[9]\n\nShe received the Eduard Rhein Ring of Honor from the German Eduard Rhein Foundation in 2007.[10][11]\n\nPersonal life\nAfter the Vostok 6 flight a rumour began circulating that she would marry Andriyan Nikolayev (1929&#8211;2004), the only bachelor cosmonaut to have flown. Nikolayev and Tereshkova married on 3 November 1963 at the Moscow Wedding Palace with Khrushchev himself presiding at the wedding party together with top government and space programme leaders.\n\nOn 8 June 1964, she gave birth to their daughter Elena Andrianovna Nikolaeva&#8211;Tereshkova,[12] who became a doctor and was the first person to have both a mother and father who had travelled into space. She and Nikolayev divorced in 1982. Her second husband, the orthopaedist Yuliy G.

<string name="Sally_Ride">Sally Kristen Ride (May 26, 1951 &#8211; July 23, 2012) was an American physicist and astronaut. Born in Los Angeles, Ride joined NASA in 1978 and, at the age of 32, became the first American woman in space.[1] After flying twice on the space shuttle Challenger, she left NASA in 1987. She worked for two years at Stanford University\'s Center for International Security and Arms Control, then the University of California, San Diego as a professor of physics, primarily researching non&#8211;linear optics and Thomson scattering. She served on the committees that investigated the Challenger and Columbia space shuttle disasters, the only person to participate on both.[2][3] Ride remains the youngest American astronaut to travel to space.[4]\n\nContents  [hide] \n1 Early years\n2 NASA career\n3 After NASA\n4 Death\n5 Personal life\n6 Awards and honors\n7 Legacy\n8 Tributes\n9 See also\n10 Notes\n11 Bibliography\n12 External links\nEarly years\nThe elder child of Dale Burdell Ride and Carol Joyce (née Anderson), Ride was born in Los Angeles, California. She had one sibling, Karen \"Bear\" Ride, who is a Presbyterian minister. Both parents were elders in the Presbyterian Church. Ride\'s mother had worked as a volunteer counselor at a women\'s correctional facility. Her father had been a political science professor at Santa Monica College.[2]\n\nRide attended Portola Junior High (now Portola Middle School) and then Westlake School for Girls in Los Angeles (now Harvard&#8211;Westlake School) on a scholarship.[2] In addition to being interested in science, she was a nationally ranked tennis player. Ride attended Swarthmore College for three semesters, took physics courses at UCLA, and then entered Stanford University as a junior, graduating with a bachelor\'s degree in English and physics. At Stanford, she earned a master\'s degree and a Ph.D. in physics while doing research on the interaction of X&#8211;rays with the interstellar medium.[5]\n\nNASA career\n\n\nSally Ride on Challenger\'s mid&#8211;deck during STS&#8211;7, 1983\nRide was one of 8,000 people who answered an advertisement in the Stanford student newspaper seeking applicants for the space program.[6] She was chosen to join NASA in 1978.[7] During her career, Ride served as the ground&#8211;based capsule communicator (CapCom) for the second and third space shuttle flights (STS&#8211;2 and STS&#8211;3) and helped develop the space shuttle\'s robot arm.[7]\n\nPrior to her first space flight, she was subject to media attention due to her gender. During a press conference, she was asked questions like, \"Will the flight affect your reproductive organs?\" and \"Do you weep when things go wrong on the job?\" Despite this and the historical significance of the mission, Ride insisted that she saw herself in only one way—as an astronaut.[7] On June 18, 1983, she became the first American woman in space as a crew member on space shuttle Challenger for STS&#8211;7. She was preceded by two Soviet women, Valentina Tereshkova in 1963 and Svetlana Savitskaya in 1982. The five&#8211;person crew of the STS&#8211;7 mission deployed two communications satellites and conducted pharmaceutical experiments. Ride was the first woman to use the robot arm in space and the first to use the arm to retrieve a satellite.[5]\n\nHer second space flight was in 1984, also on board the Challenger. She spent a total of more than 343 hours in space. Ride, who had completed eight months of training for her third flight (STS&#8211;61&#8211;M, a TDRS deployment mission) when the space shuttle Challenger disaster occurred, was named to the Rogers Commission (the presidential commission investigating the accident) and headed its subcommittee on operations. Following the investigation, Ride was assigned to NASA headquarters in Washington, D.C., where she led NASA\'s first strategic planning effort, authored a report entitled \"NASA Leadership and America\'s Future in Space\" and founded NASA\'s Office of Exploration.[5]\n\nAfter NASA\nIn 1987, Ride left her position in Washington, D.C., to work at the Stanford University Center for International Security and Arms Control. In 1989, she became a professor of physics at the University of California, San Diego, and director of the California Space Institute. From the mid&#8211;1990s until her death, Ride led two public&#8211;outreach programs for NASA — the ISS EarthKAM and GRAIL MoonKAM projects, in cooperation with NASA\'s Jet Propulsion Laboratory and UCSD. The programs allowed middle school students to request images of the Earth[8] and moon.[9] In 1999, she acted in Season 5 Episode 26 of the Touched by An Angel titled Godspeed.[10] In 2003, she was asked to serve on the Columbia Accident Investigation Board. She was the president and CEO of Sally Ride Science, a company she co&#8211;founded in 2001 that creates entertaining science programs and publications for upper elementary and middle school students, with a particular focus on girls.[11][12]\n\nAccording to Roger Boisjoly, the engineer who warned of the technical problems that led to the Challenger disaster, Ride was the only public figure to show support for him when he went public with his pre&#8211;disaster warnings (after the entire workforce of Morton&#8211;Thiokol shunned him). Sally Ride hugged him publicly to show her support for his efforts.[13]\n\nRide wrote or co&#8211;wrote seven books[14] on space aimed at children, with the goal of encouraging children to study science.[15][16]\n\nRide endorsed Barack Obama for President in 2008.[17] She was a member of the Review of United States Human Space Flight Plans Committee, an independent review requested by the Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP) on May 7, 2009.\n\nDeath\nRide died on July 23, 2012, at age 61, seventeen months after being diagnosed with pancreatic cancer.[2][18][19][20] Following cremation, her ashes were interred next to her father[21] at Woodlawn Cemetery, Santa Monica, California.[22]\n\nPersonal life\n\n\nSally Ride while promoting the Sally Ride Science Festival at UCSD in 2006\nRide was extremely private about her personal life. She married fellow NASA astronaut Steve Hawley in 1982; they divorced in 1987.[23]\n\nAfter death, her obituary revealed that Ride\'s partner of 27 years was Tam O\'Shaughnessy, a professor emerita of school psychology at San Diego State University and childhood friend, who met Ride when both were aspiring tennis players.[24][25] O\'Shaughnessy became a science teacher and writer and, later, the co&#8211;founder, chief operating officer, and executive vice president of Ride\'s company, Sally Ride Science.[26][27] O\'Shaughnessy now serves as Chair of the Board of Sally Ride Science.[28] She co&#8211;authored six books with Ride.[14] Their relationship was revealed by the company and confirmed by Ride\'s sister, who said that Ride chose to keep her personal life private, including her sickness and treatments.[29][30] Ride is the first known lesbian astronaut.[31]\n\nAwards and honors\n\n\nSally Ride communicates with ground controllers from the flight deck during the six&#8211;day mission in Challenger, 1983.\nRide received numerous awards, including the National Space Society\'s von Braun Award, the Lindbergh Eagle, and the NCAA\'s Theodore Roosevelt Award. She was inducted into the National Women\'s Hall of Fame and the Astronaut Hall of Fame and was awarded the NASA Space Flight Medal twice. Ride was the only person to serve on both of the panels investigating shuttle accidents (those for the Challenger accident and the Columbia disaster). Two elementary schools in the United States are named after her: Sally K. Ride Elementary School in The Woodlands, Texas, and Sally K. Ride Elementary School in Germantown, Maryland.[5]\n\nIn 1994, Ride received the Samuel S. Beard Award for Greatest Public Service by an Individual 35 Years or Under, an award given out annually by Jefferson Awards.[32]\n\nOn December 6, 2006, California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger and First Lady Maria Shriver inducted Ride into the California Hall of Fame at the California Museum for History, Women, and the Arts.[33]\n\nRide directed public outreach and educational programs for NASA’s GRAIL mission, which sent twin satellites to map the moon’s gravity. On December 17, 2012, the two GRAIL probes, Ebb and Flow, were directed to complete their mission by crashing on an unnamed lunar mountain near the crater Goldschmidt. NASA announced that it was naming the landing site in honor of Sally Ride.[34][35]\n\nIn 2013, the Space Foundation bestowed its highest honor, the General James E. Hill Lifetime Space Achievement Award, on Sally Ride [36]\n\nOn May 20, 2013, a National Tribute to Sally Ride was held at the Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts in Washington, D.C. On the same day, President Barack Obama announced that Ride would receive the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the highest civilian award in the United States. The medal was presented to Ride\'s life partner Tam O\'Shaughnessy in a ceremony at the White House on November 20, 2013.[37]\n\nLegacy\nIn April 2013, the US Navy announced that a research ship will be renamed in honor of Sally Ride.[38]\n\nTributes\nIn 2013, Janelle Monáe released a song called \"Sally Ride\".[39] Also in 2013, Astronouts Chris Hadfield and Catherine Coleman performed a song called \"Ride On\"[40]\n\nSee also\nBiography portal California portal LGBT portal Spaceflight portal United States portal\nList of female astronauts\nList of female explorers and travelers\nMercury 13\nWomen in science\nNotes\n^ Morrison, Patt (July 24, 2012). \"Sally Ride\'s spaceflight was one giant leap for womankind\".

<string name="Judith_Resnik">Judith Arlene Resnik (April 5, 1949 &#8211; January 28, 1986) was an American engineer and a NASA astronaut who died when the Space Shuttle Challenger was destroyed during the launch of mission STS&#8211;51&#8211;L.\n\nResnik was the second American female astronaut, logging 145 hours in orbit. She was a graduate of Carnegie Mellon University and had a Ph.D. in electrical engineering from the University of Maryland. The IEEE Judith Resnik Award for space engineering is named in her honor.\n\nContents  [hide] \n1 Early life\n2 Career\n3 Legacy\n4 See also\n5 References\n6 External links\nEarly life\nJudith Arlene Resnik was born in 1949 to Sara and Marvin, an optometrist, in Akron, Ohio. Both her parents were Jewish emigrants from Ukraine. Judith\'s brother Charles was born four years later. She attended Hebrew school. A graduate of Firestone High School in 1966, she excelled in mathematics and played classical piano. While at Firestone she achieved a perfect SAT score, the only female to do so that year. She received a B.S. in electrical engineering from Pittsburgh\'s Carnegie Mellon University in 1970, the year she married fellow student Michael Oldak.[1] They divorced in 1975. In 1977 Resnik earned a Ph.D. in electrical engineering at the University of Maryland.\n\nCareer\nUpon graduation from Carnegie Mellon, she was employed at RCA as a design engineer, and later worked with various NASA projects contracted to the company.[2]\n\nWhile working toward her doctorate, Resnik was affiliated with the National Institutes of Health as a biomedical engineer. Later, she was a systems engineer with Xerox Corporation.[3]\n\n\n\nOne of the first six women NASA astronauts, Dr. Resnik (third from left) stands behind a prototype Personal Rescue Enclosure\nResnik was recruited into the astronaut program January 1978 by actress Nichelle Nichols, who was working as a recruiter for NASA.[4] Resnik\'s first space flight was as a mission specialist on the maiden voyage of Discovery, from August to September 1984. She was likewise a mission specialist aboard Challenger for STS&#8211;51&#8211;L.[5][6][7] Resnik was the first American Jewish astronaut to go into space, the first Jewish woman, and only the second Jew to go to space (after Boris Volynov of the Soviet Union).[8]\n\nFor people accustomed to seeing images of astronauts in space, Resnik\'s first space mission still caused some notoriety. Not only was she one of the first women in space, but in weightlessness, she displayed a halo of flowing locks, a startling sight to many viewers who were accustomed to seeing closely cropped men. During the flight, she was acclaimed for her weightless acrobatics and a playful sense of humor, once holding a sign reading \"Hi Dad\" up to the camera, and displaying a sticker on her flight locker that advertised her crush on actor Tom Selleck.[9]\n\nFollowing the Challenger disaster, examination of the recovered vehicle cockpit revealed that three of the crew Personal Egress Air Packs were activated: those of Resnik, mission specialist Ellison Onizuka, and pilot Michael J. Smith. The location of Smith\'s activation switch, on the back side of his seat, means that either Resnik or Onizuka could have activated it for him. This is the only evidence available from the disaster that shows Onizuka and Resnik were alive after the cockpit separated from the vehicle. If the cabin had lost pressure, the packs alone would not have sustained the crew during the two minute descent.[10]\n\nLegacy\n\n\nMission Specialist Judith Resnik on the middeck of Discovery during STS&#8211;41&#8211;D\nResnik has been awarded multiple posthumous honors, and has been honored with landmarks and buildings being named for her, including a lunar crater Resnik, located within the Apollo impact basin on the far side of the Moon. A dormitory at her alma mater, Carnegie Mellon, and the main engineering lecture hall at the University of Maryland are named for her. A memorial to Resnik and the crew of Space Shuttle Challenger has been dedicated in Seabrook, Texas, where Resnik lived while stationed at the Johnson Space Center.\n\nThe IEEE Judith A. Resnik Award was established in 1986 by the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers and is presented annually to an individual or team in recognition of outstanding contributions to space engineering in areas of relevance to the IEEE.[11]\n\nResnik has been portrayed in works of nonfiction and fiction, including the 1990 made for TV movie Challenger where Julie Fulton portrayed her.\n\nOn February 23, 2010, Resnik was named one of ten finalists to represent Ohio in the National Statuary Hall in the U.S. Capitol in Washington, D.C.[12]\n\nSee also\nList of female astronauts\nList of Jewish astronauts\nSpace Shuttle Challenger disaster\nHistory of the Jews in Houston\nReferences\n This article incorporates public domain material from websites or documents of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration.\n\n^ \"Remembering the Challenger\".

<string name="Anna_Lee_Fisher">Anna Lee Tingle Fisher (née Sims)[1] (born August 24, 1949) is an American chemist and a NASA astronaut. Formerly married to fellow astronaut Bill Fisher, and the mother of two children, in 1984 she became the first mother in space. Fisher is the oldest active American astronaut.[2] During her career at NASA, she has been involved with three major programs: the Space Shuttle, the International Space Station and the Orion project.\n\nContents  [hide] \n1 Biography\n2 NASA career\n2.1 Post&#8211;Challenger\n2.2 Leave of absence\n2.3 Return\n3 Spaceflight experience\n4 Awards and honors\n5 References\n6 External links\nBiography\nAlthough Fisher was born in New York City, she grew up in San Pedro, California, and considers it her hometown. She is a 1967 graduate of San Pedro High School. She went on to received a bachelor of science in Chemistry in 1971 at the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA). Fisher then stayed on at UCLA and started graduate school in chemistry in the field of x&#8211;ray crystallographic studies of metallocarbonanes. The following year she moved to the UCLA medical school and received her doctor of Medicine degree in 1976. She did an internship at Harbor General Hospital in Torrance, California, in 1977. She chose to specialize in emergency medicine and worked in several hospitals in the Los Angeles area. Fisher later went back to graduate school in chemistry and received a master of science in chemistry from UCLA in 1987.\n\nNASA career\nFisher was selected as an astronaut candidate in January 1978. In August 1979, she completed her training and evaluation period, making her eligible for assignment as a mission specialist on space shuttle flight crews.[3][4][5]\n\nFollowing the one&#8211;year basic training program, Fisher\'s early NASA assignments (pre&#8211;STS&#8211;1 through STS&#8211;4) included the following:\n\nThe development and testing of the Canadarm Remote Manipulator System (RMS) &#8211; commonly called the shuttle\'s \"robotic arm\"\nThe development and testing of payload bay door contingency spacewalk procedures, the extra&#8211;small spacesuit, and contingency repair procedures;\nVerification of flight software at the Shuttle Avionics Integration Laboratory (SAIL) &#8211; in that capacity she reviewed test requirements and procedures for ascent, on&#8211;orbit, and RMS software verification &#8211; and served as a crew evaluator for verification and development testing for STS&#8211;2, STS&#8211;3 and STS&#8211;4.\nFor STS&#8211;5 through STS&#8211;7, Fisher supported vehicle integrated testing and payload testing at Kennedy Space Center. In addition, Fisher supported each Orbital Flight Test (STS 1&#8211;4) launch and landing (at either a prime or backup site) as a physician in the rescue helicopters, and provided both medical and operational inputs to the development of rescue procedures. Fisher was a CAPCOM for STS&#8211;9.\n\nShe would eventually fly in late 1984 on STS&#8211;51&#8211;A aboard Discovery. The mission deployed two satellites, and recovered two others whose PAM kick motors failed to ignite.\n\nPost&#8211;Challenger\nFisher was assigned as a mission specialist on STS&#8211;61&#8211;H prior to the Space Shuttle Challenger disaster. Following the accident she worked as the Deputy of the Mission Development Branch of the Astronaut Office, and as the astronaut office representative for Flight Data File issues. In that capacity she served as the crew representative on the Crew Procedures Change Board. Fisher served on the Astronaut Selection Board for the 1987 class of astronauts. Fisher also served in the Space Station Support Office where she worked part&#8211;time in the Space Station Operations Branch. She was the crew representative supporting space station development in the areas of training, operations concepts, and the health maintenance facility.\n\nLeave of absence\nWith her husband, astronaut Dr. William Frederick Fisher, she had two daughters, Kristin Anne (b. July 29, 1983)[6] and Kara Lynne (b. January 10, 1989).[7] Dr. Fisher decided to take an extended leave 1988 to 1996 to raise her family.\n\nReturn\nWhen she first returned to the Astronaut Office, she was assigned to the Operations Planning Branch to work on the procedures and training issues in support of the International Space Station. She served as the Branch Chief of the Operations Planning Branch from June 1997&#8211;June 1998. Following a reorganization of the Astronaut office, she was assigned as the Deputy for Operations/Training of the Space Station Branch from June 1998&#8211;June 1999. In that capacity, she had oversight responsibility for Astronaut Office inputs to the Space Station Program on issues regarding operations, procedures, and training for the ISS. She next served as Chief of the Space Station Branch of the Astronaut Office with oversight responsibility for 40&#8211;50 astronauts and support engineers. In that capacity, she coordinated all astronaut inputs to the Space Station Program Office on issues regarding the design, development, and testing of space station hardware. Additionally, she coordinated all Astronaut Office inputs to Space Station operations, procedures, and training and worked with the International Partners to negotiate common design requirements and standards for displays and procedures. She also served as the Astronaut Office representative on numerous Space Station Program Boards and Multilateral Boards. Fisher was later assigned to the Shuttle Branch and worked technical assignments in that branch. In 2012, she briefly made news when, during the landing of the Space Shuttle Discovery at Washington\'s Dulles Airport, where it was being retired to the Smithsonian Institution, she advised an aspiring astronaut to \"study Russian\". At least one commentator suggested this was a veiled criticism of the US government\'s lack of funding for the space program.[8]\n\nAs a management astronaut, she now works jointly for the Capsule Communicator and Exploration branches of NASA, working as a station CAPCOM and on display development for the Orion project.[9]\n\nSpaceflight experience\nFisher was a mission specialist on STS&#8211;51A which launched November 8, 1984. She was accompanied by Frederick Hauck (spacecraft commander), David Walker (pilot) and fellow mission specialists Dr. Joseph Allen and Dale Gardner.

During that time she taught undergraduate physics labs and was the recipient of several research assistantships. She conducted research in low temperature solid state physics, including studies in electron tunneling and vibrational modes of absorbed molecular species on metallic substrates (surfaces) at liquid helium temperatures. Results of her research have been published in several journals.\n\nGodwin is an instrument rated private pilot.\n\nNASA career\nGodwin joined NASA in 1980, in the Payload Operations Division, Mission Operations Directorate, where she worked in payload integration (attached payloads and Spacelabs), and as a flight controller and payloads officer on several Space Shuttle missions.\n\nSelected by NASA as an astronaut candidate in June 1985, Godwin became an astronaut in July 1986. Her technical assignments have included working with flight software verification in the Shuttle Avionics Integration Laboratory (SAIL), and coordinating mission development activities for the Inertial Upper Stage (IUS), deployable payloads, and Spacelab missions. She also has served as Chief of Astronaut Appearances, Chief of the Mission Development Branch of the Astronaut Office and as the astronaut liaison to its Educational Working Group, Deputy Chief of the Astronaut Office, and Deputy Director, Flight Crew Operations Directorate. Godwin is currently the Assistant to the Director for Exploration, Flight Crew Operations Directorate at the Johnson Space Center.\n\nA veteran of four space flights, Godwin has logged over 38 days in space, including over ten EVA hours in two spacewalks . In 1991 she served as a Mission Specialist on STS&#8211;37, was the Payload Commander on STS&#8211;59 in 1994, flew on STS&#8211;76 in 1996, a Mir docking mission, and served on STS&#8211;108/International Space Station Flight UF&#8211;1 in 2001.[1][2]\n\nSpaceflight experience\n\n\nGodwin performs a spacewalk on STS&#8211;108.\nSTS&#8211;37 Atlantis (April 5&#8211;April 11, 1991) was launched from the Kennedy Space Center, Florida, and returned to land at Edwards Air Force Base, California. During the 93 orbits of the mission, the crew deployed the Gamma Ray Observatory (GRO) to study gamma ray sources in the universe. GRO, at almost 35,000 pounds (16 Mg), was the heaviest payload deployed to date by the Shuttle Remote Manipulator System (RMS). The crew also conducted an unscheduled space walk to free the GRO high gain antenna, and conducted the first scheduled extravehicular activity in 5½ years to test concepts for moving about large space structures. Several middeck experiments and activities were conducted including test of elements of a heat pipe to study fluid transfer processed in microgravity environments (SHARE), a chemical processing apparatus to characterize the structure of biological materials (BIMDA), and an experiment to grow larger and more perfect protein crystals than can be grown on the ground (PCG II). Atlantis carried amateur radio equipment for voice contact, fast scan and slow scan TV, and packet radio. Several hundred contacts were made with amateur radio operators around the world. Mission duration was 143 hours, 32 minutes, 44 seconds.\n\nSTS&#8211;59 Endeavour (April 9&#8211;April 20, 1994) was the Space Radar Laboratory (SRL) mission. SRL consisted of three large radars, SIR&#8211;C/X&#8211;SAR (Shuttle Imaging Radar C/X&#8211;Band Synthetic Aperture Radar), and a carbon monoxide sensor that were used to enhance studies of the Earth\'s surface and atmosphere. The imaging radars operated in three frequencies and four polarizations. This multispectral capability of the radars provided information about the Earth\'s surface over a wide range of scales not discernible with previous single&#8211;frequency experiments. The carbon monoxide sensor MAPS (Measurement of Air Pollution by Satellite) used gas filter radiometry to measure the global distribution of CO in the troposphere. Real&#8211;time crew observations of surface phenomena and climatic conditions augmented with over 14,000 photographs aided investigators in interpretation and calibration of the data. The mission concluded with a landing at Edwards AFB after orbiting the Earth 183 times in 269 hours, 29 minutes.\n\nSTS&#8211;76 Atlantis (March 22&#8211;March 31, 1996) was the third docking mission to the Russian space station Mir. Following rendezvous and docking with Mir, transfer of a NASA astronaut to Mir for a 5&#8211;month stay was accomplished to begin a continuous presence of U.S. astronauts aboard Mir for the next two&#8211;year period. The crew also transferred 4800 pounds (2,200 kg) of science and mission hardware, food, water and air to Mir and returned over 1100 pounds (500 kg) of U.S. and ESA science and Russian hardware. Godwin performed a six&#8211;hour spacewalk, the first while docked to an orbiting space station, to mount experiment packages on the Mir docking module to detect and assess debris and contamination in a space station environment. The packages will be retrieved by a future shuttle mission. The Spacehab module carried in the Shuttle payload bay was utilized extensively for transfer and return stowage of logistics and science and also carried Biorack, a small multipurpose laboratory used during this mission for research of plant and animal cellular function. This mission was also the first flight of Kidsat, an electronic camera controlled by classroom students via a Ku&#8211;band link between JSC Mission Control and the Shuttle, which uses digital photography from the Shuttle for science and education. The STS&#8211;76 mission was accomplished in 145 orbits of the Earth, traveling 3.8 million miles (6.1 Gm) in 221 hours and 15 minutes.\n\nSTS&#8211;108 Endeavour (December 5&#8211;December 17, 2001) was the 12th shuttle flight to visit the International Space Station. Endeavour’s crew delivered the Expedition&#8211;4 crew and returned the Expedition&#8211;3 crew. The crew unloaded over 3 short tons (2.7 Mg) of supplies, logistics and science experiments from the Raffaello Multi&#8211;Purpose Logistics Module and repacked over 2 short tons (1.8 Mg) of items no longer needed on the station for return to Earth. Godwin used the Shuttle’s robotic arm to install the MPLM onto the Station Node, and participated in a space walk to wrap thermal blankets around ISS Solar Array Beta Gimbal Assemblies. STS&#8211;108 was accomplished in 185 Earth orbits, traveling 4.8 million miles (7.7 Gm) in 283 hours and 36 minutes.\n\nBibliography\nArticles\nDiane L. Evans, Ellen R. Stofan, Thomas D.

<string name="Helen_Sharman">Helen Patricia Sharman, OBE PhD (born 30 May 1963), is a British chemist who became the first Briton in space and the first woman to visit the Mir space station.\n\nSharman was born in Grenoside, Sheffield (where she attended Grenoside Junior and Infant School), later moving to Greenhill. After studying at Jordanthorpe Comprehensive, she received a B.Sc. in chemistry at the University of Sheffield in 1984 and a Ph.D. from Birkbeck, University of London. She worked as an engineer for GEC in London and later as a chemist for Mars Incorporated dealing with flavourant properties of chocolate. She worked with chocolate because she liked chocolate and wanted to explore the further flavours and scents of pure alpine chocolate.[1]\n\nContents  [hide] \n1 Project Juno\n2 Later career\n3 Awards and honours\n4 Bibliography\n5 References\n6 External links\nProject Juno\nMain article: Project Juno\nAfter responding to a radio advertisement asking for applicants to be the first British astronaut, Sharman was selected to travel into space on 25 November 1989 ahead of nearly 13,000 other applicants.[1] The programme was known as Project Juno and was a cooperative arrangement between the Soviet Union and a group of British companies.\n\nSharman has been wrongly described as \"selected by lottery\". She was subjected to a rigorous selection process that gave weight to scientific, educational and aerospace backgrounds as well as the ability to learn a foreign language. A lottery was one of several schemes used to raise money to underwrite the cost of the flight.\n\n\n\nSokol space suit worn by Sharman, at the National Space Centre in Leicester.\nBefore flying, Sharman spent 18 months in intensive flight training in Star City. The Project Juno consortium failed to raise the monies expected, and the programme was almost cancelled. Reportedly Mikhail Gorbachev ordered it to proceed under Soviet expense in the interests of international relations, but in the absence of western underwriting, less expensive experiments were substituted for those in the original plans.\n\nThe Soyuz TM&#8211;12 mission, which included Soviet cosmonauts Anatoly Artsebarsky and Sergei Krikalev, launched on 18 May 1991 and lasted eight days, most of that time spent at the Mir space station. Sharman\'s tasks included medical and agricultural tests, photographing the British Isles, and participating in an amateur radio hookup with British schoolchildren. She landed aboard Soyuz TM&#8211;11 on 26 May 1991, along with Viktor Afanasyev and Musa Manarov.\n\nSharman was just 27 years and 11 months old when she went into space, making her (as of 2007) the fifth youngest of the 528 individuals who have flown in space. The second youngest, Valentina Tereshkova, became the first woman in space in 1963 at the age of 26 years and 3 months.\n\nSharman has not returned to space, although she was one of three British candidates in the 1992 European Space Agency astronaut selection process and was on the shortlist of 25 applicants in 1998.\n\nFor her Project Juno accomplishments, Sharman received a star on the Sheffield Walk of Fame.\n\nLater career\nSharman currently works as a broadcaster and lecturer specialising in science education. Currently she has joined the National Physical Laboratory as group leader.[citation needed]\n\nAwards and honours\nIn 1991, she was chosen to light the flame at the 1991 Summer Universiade, held in Sheffield. On live international television, she tripped while running through the infield of Don Valley Stadium, sending the burning embers onto the track. Encouraged to continue her run, without any flame from the torch, she proceeded round the track and climbed to the ceremonial flame. Despite the lack of any fire from the torch the ceremonial flame still ignited.[2] For her pioneering efforts, Sharman was appointed an OBE in 1993, and the same year an honorary Fellow of the Royal Society of Chemistry.[3] The British School in Assen, Netherlands is named the Helen Sharman School after her. In addition there is a house named after her at Wallington High School for Girls, a grammar school in the London Borough of Sutton, where each house is named after a high achieving and influential woman. The science block of BullersWood school, Chislehurst, Kent was opened by Sharman in 1994 and is called Sharman House. There is also a house named after her at Rugby High School for Girls a girls grammar school where houses are named after four influential women.\n\nBibliography\nSeize the Moment: Autobiography of Britain\'s First Astronaut, autobiography, with Christopher Priest and a foreword by Arthur C.

She graduated from Mineral Wells High School, in 1962, then received her Bachelor of Science degree in Chemistry and Biology from Tarleton State University in 1968, and her Ph.D. from Texas Woman\'s University in 1972.\n\nShe is a member of the American Association for the Advancement of Science, American Society for Gravitational Science and Biology, American Society for Bone and Mineral Research, American Society for Cell Biology and the Association of Space Explorers.\n\nAcademic experience\nHughes&#8211;Fulford entered college at the age of 16 and earned her B.Sc. degree in chemistry and biology from Tarleton State University in 1968. In 1968, Dr. Hughes&#8211;Fulford began her graduate work studying plasma chemistry at Texas Woman\'s University as a National Science Foundation Graduate Fellow from 1968&#8211;1971. She was an American Association of University Women fellow from 1971&#8211;1972. Upon completing her doctorate degree at TWU in 1972, Dr. Hughes&#8211;Fulford joined the faculty of Southwestern Medical School, University of Texas at Dallas as a postdoctoral fellow with Marvin D. Siperstein where her research focused on regulation of cholesterol metabolism. Dr. Hughes&#8211;Fulford has contributed over 90 papers and abstracts on bone and cancer growth regulation. Since then, she was named the Federal Employee of the Year for the Western Region in 1985, International Zontian in 1992 and Marin County Woman of the Year in 1994. She was a major in the US Army Reserve Medical Corps until 1995.\n\nSelected as a payload specialist by NASA in January 1983, Hughes&#8211;Fulford flew in June 1991 aboard STS&#8211;40 Spacelab Life Sciences (SLS 1), the first Spacelab mission dedicated to biomedical studies. The SLS&#8211;1 mission flew over 3.2 million miles in 146 orbits and its crew completed over 18 experiments during a 9&#8211;day period, bringing back more medical data than any previous NASA flight. Mission duration was 218 hours, 14 minutes and 20 seconds.[1][2][3]\n\nHughes&#8211;Fulford is a Professor at the University of California Medical Center at San Francisco where she continues her research. As the Director of the Laboratory for Cell Growth and Differentiation and Scientific Advisor to the Under Secretary of Veteran\'s Affairs, she studies the control of human prostate cancer growth with VA grants and the regulation of bone and lymphocyte activation with NASA grants.\n\nShe was the Principal Investigator (PI) on a series of SpaceHab/Biorack experiments, which examined the regulation of osteoblast (bone cell) growth. These experiments flew on STS&#8211;76, in March 1996, STS&#8211;81 in January 1997 and STS&#8211;84 in May 1997. These studies examined the root causes of osteoporosis that occurs in astronauts during spaceflight. She found changes in anabolic signal transduction in microgravity. Currently, in collaboration with Dr. Augusto Cogoli of Zurich, Switzerland, she is examining changes in T&#8211;cell gene induction in spaceflight in a joint NASA/ESA International Space Station experiment that will be going up on the Soyuz TMA&#8211;9 in September 2006. The previous Leukin experiment with Dr. Cogoli was lost on the STS&#8211;107 mission. This study (Leukin) examines the mechanism of action causing the decrease in T&#8211;cell activation in microgravity, a medical problem that was first found in returning Apollo astronauts. Isolated T&#8211;cells will be activated in spaceflight on Biopack hardware; the altered activation will be examined by reverse&#8211;transcriptase&#8211;polymerase chain reaction (RTPCR) analysis of induced genes.

<string name="Mae_Jemison">Mae Carol Jemison (born October 17, 1956) is an American physician and NASA astronaut. She became the first Black woman to travel in space when she went into orbit aboard the Space Shuttle Endeavour on September 12, 1992. After her medical education and a brief general practice, Jemison served in the Peace Corps from 1985 to 1987, when she was selected by NASA to join the astronaut corps. She resigned from NASA in 1993 to form a company researching the application of technology to daily life. She has appeared on television several times, including as an actress in an episode of Star Trek: The Next Generation. She is a dancer, and holds nine honorary doctorates in science, engineering, letters, and the humanities.\n\nMae Carol Jemison was born in Decatur, Alabama. on October 17, 1956,[1] the youngest child of Charlie Jemison and Dorothy Green. Her father was a maintenance supervisor for a charity organization, and her mother worked most of her career as an elementary school teacher of English and math at the Beethoven School in Chicago.[2][3] According to a DNA analysis, she descended from people of Cameroon, Nigeria, Sierra Leone, Ghana and Senegal.[4] The family moved to Chicago, Illinois, when Jemison was three years old, to take advantage of better educational opportunities there. Jemison says that as a young girl growing up in Chicago she always assumed she would get into space. \"I thought, by now, we\'d be going into space like you were going to work.\"[5] She said it was easier to apply to be a shuttle astronaut, \"rather than waiting around in a cornfield, waiting for ET to pick me up or something.\"[5]\n\nIn her childhood, Jemison learned to make connections to science by studying nature. \"It sounds a little gross, but I was fascinated with pus,\" Jemison said. Once when a splinter infected her thumb as a little girl, Jemison\'s mother turned it into a learning experience. She ended up doing a whole project about pus.[6] Jemison would not let anyone dissuade her from pursuing a career in science. \"In kindergarten, my teacher asked me what I wanted to be when I grew up, and I told her a scientist,\" Jemison says. \"She said, \'Don\'t you mean a nurse?\' Now, there\'s nothing wrong with being a nurse, but that\'s not what I wanted to be.\"[7]\n\nJemison says she was inspired by Martin Luther King Jr.; to her King\'s dream was not an elusive fantasy but a call to action. \"Too often people paint him like Santa &#8211;&#8211; smiley and inoffensive,\" says Jemison. \"But when I think of Martin Luther King, I think of attitude, audacity, and bravery.\"[8] Jemison thinks the civil rights movement was all about breaking down the barriers to human potential. \"The best way to make dreams come true is to wake up.\"[8]\n\nJemison loved science growing up but she also loved the arts.[9] Jemison began dancing at the age of eleven[10] \"I love dancing! I took all kinds of dance — African dancing, ballet, jazz, modern — even Japanese dancing. I wanted to become a professional dancer,\" said Jemison.[11] At the age of 14 in high school she auditioned for the leading role of \"Maria\" in West Side Story.[9] She didn\'t get the part but Jemison\'s dancing skills did get her into the line up as a background dancer.[9] \"I had a problem with the singing but I danced and acted pretty well enough for them to choose me. I think that people sometimes limit themselves and so rob themselves of the opportunity to realise their dreams. For me, I love the sciences and I also love the arts,\" says Jemison.[9] \"I saw the theatre as an outlet for this passion and so I decided to pursue this dream.\"[9] Later during her senior year in college, she was trying to decide whether to go to New York to medical school or become a professional dancer. Her mother told her, \"You can always dance if you\'re a doctor, but you can\'t doctor if you\'re a dancer.\"[12]\n\nJemison graduated from Chicago\'s Morgan Park High School in 1973[7] and entered Stanford University at age 16.[6] \"I was naive and stubborn enough that it didn’t faze me,\" Jemison said.[6] \"It’s not until recently that I realized that 16 was particularly young or that there were even any issues associated with my parents having enough confidence in me to [allow me to] go that far away from home.\"[6] Jemison graduated from Stanford in 1977, receiving a B.S. in chemical engineering and fulfilling the requirements for a B.A. in African and Afro&#8211;American Studies.[6] Jemison said that majoring in engineering as a black woman was difficult because race was always an issue in the United States.[13] \"Some professors would just pretend I wasn\'t there. I would ask a question and a professor would act as if it was just so dumb, the dumbest question he had ever heard. Then, when a white guy would ask the same question, the professor would say, \"That\'s a very astute observation.\'\"[13] In an interview with the Des Moines Register in 2008 Jemison said that it was difficult to go to Stanford at 16, but thinks her youthful arrogance may have helped her.[14] \"I did have to say, \'I\'m going to do this and I don\'t give a damn\'.\" She points out the unfairness of the necessity for women and minorities to have that attitude in some fields.[14]\n\nJemison obtained her Doctor of Medicine degree in 1981 from Cornell Medical College (now Weill Medical College of Cornell University) She interned at Los Angeles County&#8211;USC Medical Center and later worked as a general practitioner. During medical school Jemison traveled to Cuba, Kenya and Thailand, to provide primary medical care to people living there.[15] During her years at Cornell Medical College, Jemison took lessons in modern dance at the Alvin Ailey school.[10] Jemison later built a dance studio in her home and has choreographed and produced several shows of modern jazz and African dance.[2][12]\n\nContents  [hide] \n1 Peace Corps\n2 NASA career\n2.1 Resignation\n3 Science and technology\n4 Television appearances\n5 Other public appearances\n6 Other news\n7 Honors and awards\n8 Filmography\n9 Bibliography\n10 See also\n11 References\n12 Further reading\n13 External links\nPeace Corps\nAfter completing her medical training, Jemison joined the staff of the Peace Corps and served as a Peace Corps Medical Officer from 1983 to 1985 responsible for the health of Peace Corps Volunteers serving in Liberia and Sierra Leone.[12] Jemison\'s work in the Peace Corps included supervising the pharmacy, laboratory, medical staff as well as providing medical care, writing self&#8211;care manuals, and developing and implementing guidelines for health and safety issues. Jemison also worked with the Center for Disease Control (CDC) helping with research for various vaccines.[15]\n\nOnce while serving as a doctor for the Peace Corps, a volunteer got sick and a doctor diagnosed malaria. The volunteer got progressively worse and Jemison was sure it was meningitis with life&#8211;threatening complications that could not be treated in Sierra Leone. Jemison called for an Air Force hospital plane based in Germany for a military medical evacuation at a cost of $80,000.[12] The embassy questioned whether Jemison had the authority to give such an order but she told them she did not need anyone\'s permission for a medical decision. By the time the plane reached Germany with Jemison and the volunteer on board, she had been up with the patient for 56 hours. The patient survived.[12]\n\nNASA career\n\n\nSTS&#8211;47 Mission Specialist Mae Jemison appears to be clicking her heels in zero gravity in the center aisle of the Spacelab Japan (SLJ) science module aboard the Earth&#8211;orbiting Endeavour, Orbiter Vehicle (OV) 105. Making her only flight in space, Jemison was joined by five other NASA astronauts and a Japanese payload specialist for eight days of research in support of the SLJ mission, a joint effort between Japan and United States.[16]\nAfter the flight of Sally Ride in 1983, Jemison felt the astronaut program had opened up, so she applied.[2] Jemison\'s inspiration for joining NASA was African&#8211;American actress Nichelle Nichols, who portrayed Lieutenant Uhura on Star Trek.[6] Jemison was turned down on her first application to NASA, but in 1987 Jemison was accepted on her second application.[15] \"I got a call saying \'Are you still interested?\' and I said \'Yeah\',\" says Jemison.[17]\n\n\n\nJemison at the Kennedy Space Center in January 1992.\nHer work with NASA before her shuttle launch included launch support activities at the Kennedy Space Center in Florida and verification of Shuttle computer software in the Shuttle Avionics Integration Laboratory (SAIL).[18][19][20] \"I did things like help to support the launch of vehicles at Kennedy Space Center,\" said Jemison.[17] \"I was in the first class of astronauts selected after the Challenger accident back in 1986, ... [I] actually worked the launch of the first flight after the Challenger accident.[17]\n\nJemison flew her only space mission from September 12 to 20, 1992 as a Mission Specialist on STS&#8211;47. \"The first thing I saw from space was Chicago, my hometown,\" said Jemison. \"I was working on the middeck where there aren\'t many windows, and as we passed over Chicago, the commander called me up to the flight deck. It was such a significant moment because since I was a little girl I had always assumed I would go into space,\" Jemison added.[12]\n\nBecause of her love of dance and as a salute to creativity,[2] Jemison took a poster from the Alvin Ailey American Dance Company along with her on the flight.[21] \"Many people do not see a connection between science and dance,\" says Jemison.[10] \"but I consider them both to be expressions of the boundless creativity that people have to share with one another.\"[10] Jemison also took several small art objects from West African countries to symbolize that space belongs to all nations.[2] Also on this flight, according to Bessie Coleman biographer Doris L. Rich, Jemison also took into orbit a photo of Coleman—Coleman was the very first Afro&#8211;American woman to ever fly an airplane. (Coleman died after falling from her Curtiss Biplane in 1926.)\n\nSTS&#8211;47 was a cooperative mission between the United States and Japan that included 44 Japanese and United States life science and materials processing experiments. Jemison logged 190 hours, 30 minutes, 23 seconds in space.[15]\n\nResignation\nJemison resigned from NASA in March 1993.[12] \"I left NASA because I\'m very interested in how social sciences interact with technologies,\" says Jemison.[22] \"People always think of technology as something having silicon in it. But a pencil is technology. Any language is technology. Technology is a tool we use to accomplish a particular task and when one talks about appropriate technology in developing countries, appropriate may mean anything from fire to solar electricity.\"[22] Although Jemison\'s departure from NASA was amicable, NASA was not thrilled to see her leave.[6] \"NASA had spent a lot of money training her; she also filled a niche, obviously, being a woman of color,\" said Homer Hickam, a training manager for NASA’s space station efforts who later wrote the book Rocket Boys which was adapted into the film October Sky. Hickam trained Jemison for her flight on Spacelab&#8211;J/STS&#8211;47.[6] In an interview with the Des Moines Register on October 16, 2008 Jemison said that she was not driven to be the \"first black woman to go into space.\" \"I wouldn\'t have cared less if 2,000 people had gone up before me... I would still have had my hand up, \'I want to do this.\'\"[14]\n\nScience and technology\nExternal video\n\n Mae Jemison on \"The Importance of Investing in Science and Basic Research\", 2009, Chemical Heritage Foundation\nJemison is a Professor&#8211;at&#8211;Large at Cornell University and was a professor of Environmental Studies at Dartmouth College from 1995 to 2002.[23] Jemison continues to advocate strongly in favor of science education and getting minority students interested in science. She sees science and technology as being very much a part of society, and African&#8211;Americans as having been deeply involved in U.S. science and technology from the beginning.[17]\n\nIn 1993 Jemison founded her own company, the Jemison Group that researches, markets, and develops science and technology for daily life.[12] Jemison founded the Dorothy Jemison Foundation for Excellence and named the foundation in honor of her mother.[24] \"My parents were the best scientists I knew,\" Jemison said, \"because they were always asking questions.\"[24] One of the projects of Jemison\'s foundation is The Earth We Share (TEWS), an international science camp where students, ages 12 to 16, work to solve current global problems, like \"How Many People Can the Earth Hold\" and \"Predict the Hot Public Stocks of The Year 2030.\"[23] The four&#8211;week residential program helps students build critical thinking and problem solving skills through an experiential curriculum.[23] Camps have been held at Dartmouth College, Colorado School of Mines, Choate Rosemary Hall and other sites around the United States.[24] TEWS was introduced internationally to high school students in day programs in South Africa and Tunisia.[25] In 1999, TEWS was expanded overseas to adults at the Zermatt Creativity and Leadership Symposium held in Switzerland.[25]\n\nIn 1999, Jemison founded BioSentient Corp and has been working to develop a portable device that allows mobile monitoring of the involuntary nervous system.[23] BioSentient has obtained the license to commercialize NASA\'s space&#8211;age technology known as Autogenic Feedback Training Exercise (AFTE), a patented technique that uses biofeedback and autogenic therapy to allow patients to monitor and control their physiology as a possible treatment for anxiety and stress&#8211;related disorders.[23] \"BioSentient is examining AFTE as a treatment for anxiety, nausea, migraine and tension headaches, chronic pain, hypertension and hypotension, and stress&#8211;related disorders,\" says Jemison.[26]\n\nTelevision appearances\nIn 1993, Jemison appeared on an episode of Star Trek: The Next Generation.[27] LeVar Burton found out from a friend that Jemison was a big Star Trek fan and asked her if she would be interested in being on the show, and she said, \"Yeah!!\"[28] The result was an appearance as Lieutenant Palmer in the episode \"Second Chances\".[29] Jemison has the distinction of being the first real astronaut ever to appear on Star Trek.[29]\n\nIn 2006, Jemison participated in African American Lives, a PBS television miniseries hosted by Henry Louis Gates, Jr., that traced the family history of eight famous African Americans using historical research and genetic techniques.[30] Jemison found to her surprise that she is 13% East Asian in her genetic makeup.[30]\n\nFebruary 2, 2013, Jemison appeared as the \"Not My Job\" guest on NPR\'s Wait Wait Don\'t Tell Me [1], answering questions about airport shuttles.\n\nOther public appearances\nJemison is an active public speaker who appears before private and public groups promoting science and technology as well as providing an inspirational and educational message for young people. \"Having been an astronaut gives me a platform,\" says Jemison,\"but I\'d blow it if I just talked about the Shuttle. \"Jemison uses her platform to speak out on the gap in the quality of health&#8211;care between the United States and the Third World. \"Martin Luther King [Jr.] ... didn\'t just have a dream, he got things done.\"[31]\n\nJemison sometimes appears at charity events. In 2007, Jemison walked the runway, wearing Lyn Devon, at the Red Dress Heart Truth fashion show during Fashion Week in New York to help raise money to fight heart disease.[32]\n\nOn February 17, 2008 Jemison was the featured speaker for the 100th anniversary of the founding of the Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority. Jemison paid tribute to Alpha Kappa Alpha by carrying the sorority\'s banner with her on her shuttle flight. Jemison\'s space suit is a part of the sorority\'s national traveling Centennial Exhibit. Jemison is an honorary member of Alpha Kappa Alpha, a sorority founded in 1908 at Howard University to address the social issues of the time and promote scholarship among black women.[33]\n\nThe Des Moines Register interviewed Jemison on October 16, 2008 and reported that she has mixed feelings about the term \"role model\". \"Here\'s the deal: Everybody\'s a role model.... Role models can be good or bad, positive or negative.\"[14]\n\nJemison participated with First Lady Michelle Obama in a forum for promising girls in the Washington, D.C. public schools in March 2009.\n\nJemison also appeared in Wayne State University to meet with the 7th grade Burton International Academy student.\n\nOther news\nIn the spring of 1996, Jemison filed a complaint against a Texas police officer accusing him of police brutality during a traffic stop that ended in her arrest.[34] She was pulled over by Nassau Bay, Texas officer Henry Hughes for allegedly making an illegal U&#8211;turn and arrested after Hughes learned of a warrant on Jemison for a speeding charge. In her complaint, Jemison said the officer physically and emotionally mistreated her and Jemison\'s attorney said she was forced to the ground and handcuffed. Jemison said in a televised interview that the incident has altered her feelings about police there. \"I always felt safe and comfortable [around the police]. I don\'t feel that way anymore at Nassau Bay and that\'s a shame,\" she said.[34]\n\nIn 2007, diagnostic test provider Gen&#8211;Probe Inc. announced that they would not accept the resignation of Jemison from their Board of Directors. Jemison had failed to be re&#8211;elected to the board in a vote of the shareholders of the company at the company\'s May 31 annual stockholders meeting. The company said it believes Jemison\'s failed re&#8211;election was the result of a recommendation by advisory firm Institutional Shareholder Services that shareholders vote against her due to her poor attendance at board meetings. Gen&#8211;Probe determined that Jemison\'s two absences in 2006 were for valid reasons and said Jemison had attended all regular and special board and committee meetings since September.[35]\n\nHonors and awards\n\n\nJemison on 1996 Azeri postage stamp.\n1988 Essence Science and Technology Award\n1990 Gamma Sigma Sigma Woman of the Year[36]\n1991 McCall\'s 10 Outstanding Women for the 90s\n1991 Pumpkin Magazine\'s (a Japanese Monthly) One of the Women for the Coming New Century\n1992 Johnson Publications Black Achievement Trailblazers Award\n1993 National Women\'s Hall of Fame\n1993 Ebony magazine 50 Most Influential women\n1993 Kilby Science Award\n1993 Montgomery Fellow, Dartmouth\n1993 People magazine\'s \"50 Most Beautiful and sexy People in the World\"\n1993 Turner Trumpet Award\n1997 Chicago History Museum \"Making History Award\" for Distinction in Science Medicine and Technology.\n2002 listed among the 100 Greatest African Americans according to Molefi Kete Asante.[37]\n2003 Intrepid Award by the National Organization for girls[38]\n2004 International Space Hall of Fame\nNASA Space Flight Medal\n2005 The National Audubon Society, Rachel Carson Award\nInstitutions\n1992 Mae C.

<string name="Susan_J_Helms">Susan Jane Helms (born February 26, 1958) is a retired lieutenant general in the United States Air Force and a former NASA astronaut. She was the commander, 14th Air Force (Air Forces Strategic); and commander, Joint Functional Component Command for Space at Vandenberg Air Force Base in California.[1] Helms was a crew member on five Space Shuttle missions and was a resident of the International Space Station (ISS) for over five months in 2001. While participating in ISS Expedition 2, she and Jim Voss conducted an 8 hour and 56 minute spacewalk, the longest to date.[2] Helms officially retired from the United States Air Force in 2014.\n\nContents  [hide] \n1 Personal life\n2 Education\n3 Organizations\n4 Military career\n5 Spaceflight experience\n6 Awards and decorations\n7 Dates of rank\n8 References\n9 External links\nPersonal life\nHelms was born in Charlotte, North Carolina, but considers Portland, Oregon, to be her hometown. She enjoys piano and other musical activities, jogging, traveling, reading, computers, and cooking. Her parents, Lieutenant Colonel (Retired, USAF) Pat and Dori Helms, reside in Denver, Colorado. She has three sisters.\n\nEducation\n1976: Graduated from Parkrose Senior High School, Portland, Oregon\n1980: Received a bachelor of science degree in aeronautical engineering from the United States Air Force Academy\n1985: Received a master of science degree in aeronautics/astronautics from Stanford University\nOrganizations\nWomen Military Aviators\nU.S. Air Force Academy Association of Graduates\nStanford Alumni Association\nAssociation of Space Explorers\nSea/Space Symposium\nChi Omega\nMilitary career\nHelms graduated from the U.S. Air Force Academy in 1980. She received her commission and was assigned to Eglin Air Force Base, Florida, as an F&#8211;16 weapons separation engineer with the Air Force Armament Laboratory. In 1982, she became the lead engineer for F&#8211;15 weapons separation. In 1984, she was selected to attend graduate school. She received her degree from Stanford University in 1985 and was assigned as an assistant professor of aeronautics at the U.S. Air Force Academy. In 1987, she attended the Air Force Test Pilot School at Edwards Air Force Base, California. After completing one year of training as a flight test engineer, Helms was assigned as a USAF Exchange Officer to the Aerospace Engineering Test Establishment, at Canadian Forces Base Cold Lake in Alberta, Canada, where she worked as a flight test engineer and project officer on the CF&#8211;18 aircraft. She was managing the development of a CF&#8211;18 flight control system simulation for the Canadian Forces when selected for the astronaut program.\n\n\n\nHelms as a brigadier general in the U.S. Air Force\nAfter a 12&#8211;year NASA career that included 211 days in space, Helms returned to the U.S. Air Force in July 2002 to take a position at HQ USAF Space Command. After a stint as the division chief of the Space Superiority Division of the Requirements Directorate of Air Force Space Command in Colorado Springs, Colorado, she served as vice commander of the 45th Space Wing at Patrick Air Force Base near Cape Canaveral, Florida. She then served as deputy director of operations (Technical Training) for Air Education and Training Command at Randolph Air Force Base near San Antonio, Texas. Helms served on the Return To Flight task group after the Columbia accident.[3] She was promoted to brigadier general in June 2006 and became commander of the 45th Space Wing on the same day of her promotion.[1]\n\nSusan Jane Helms\nBorn	 February 26, 1958 (age 56)\nCharlotte, North Carolina, U.S.\nAllegiance	United States of America\nService/branch	United States Air Force\nYears of service	1980 &#8211; 2014\nRank	 Lieutenant General\nUnit	United States Strategic Command\nAwards	NASA Distinguished Service Medal\nLegion of Merit (3)\nDefense Superior Service Medal\nDefense Meritorious Service Medal (2)\nNASA Outstanding Leadership Medal\nHelms was promoted to major general in August 2009.[1] She served as the Director of Plans and Policy, U.S. Strategic Command, Offutt Air Force Base, Nebraska. She was directly responsible to the U.S. Strategic Command commander for the development and implementation of national security policy and guidance; military strategy and guidance; space and weapons employment concepts and policy; and joint doctrine as they apply to the command and the execution of its missions. She was also responsible for the development of the nation\'s strategic war plan, strategic support plans for theater combatant commanders and contingency planning for the global strike mission.\n\nIn January 2011, Helms was promoted to lieutenant general and assumed duties as commander, 14th Air Force (Air Forces Strategic), Air Force Space Command and Commander, Joint Functional Component Command for Space, US Strategic Command[1][4][5][6]\n\nAs a flight test engineer, Helms has flown in 30 different types of U.S. and Canadian military aircraft.[citation needed]\n\nIn 2013, Helms was nominated by President Barack Obama to become vice commander of the Air Force Space Command. Senator Claire McCaskill placed a permanent hold on the nomination because Helms had dismissed a charge of a sexual assault in her role as the General Court&#8211;Martial Convening Authority, who is required to review all findings.[7][8] As Helms\'s lawyer explained, Helms felt the prosecution had failed to prove its case beyond a reasonable doubt.[9][10] Obama eventually withdrew the Helms\'s nomination.[11]\n\nSpaceflight experience\n\n\nNASA portrait of Helms\nSelected by NASA in January 1990, Helms became an astronaut in July 1991. She flew on STS&#8211;54 (1993), STS&#8211;64 (1994), STS&#8211;78 (1996), STS&#8211;101 (2000) and served aboard the International Space Station as a member of the ISS Expedition 2 crew (2001). A veteran of five space flights, Helms logged 5,064 hours in space, including an EVA of 8 hours and 56 minutes (world record).[12][13][14]\n\nSTS&#8211;54 Endeavour, January 13&#8211;19, 1993. The primary objective of this mission was the deployment of a $200&#8211;million NASA Tracking and Data Relay Satellite (TDRS&#8211;F). A diffuse X&#8211;ray spectrometer (DXS) carried in the payload bay, collected over 80,000 seconds of quality X&#8211;ray data that will enable investigators to answer questions about the origin of the Milky Way galaxy. The crew demonstrated the physics principles of everyday toys to an interactive audience of elementary school students across the United States. A highly successful extra&#8211;vehicular activity (EVA) resulted in many lessons learned that will benefit International Space Station assembly. Mission duration was 5 days, 23 hours, 38 minutes, 17 seconds.\n\n\n\nHelms views the topography of a point on Earth from the nadir window of the ISS.\nSTS&#8211;64 Discovery, September 9&#8211;20, 1994. On this flight, Helms served as the flight engineer for orbiter operations and the primary RMS operator aboard Space Shuttle. The major objective of this flight was to validate the design and operating characteristics of Lidar in Space Technology Experiment (LITE) by gathering data about the Earth\'s troposphere and stratosphere. Additional objectives included the deploy and retrieval of SPARTAN&#8211;201, a free&#8211;flying satellite that investigated the physics of the solar corona, and the testing of a new EVA maneuvering device. The Shuttle Plume Impingement Flight Experiment (SPIFEX) was used to collect extensive data on the effects of jet thruster impingement, in preparation for proximity tasks such as space station docking.

Her parents were James E. and Rose Marie Collins, immigrants from County Cork, Ireland.[1] She has three siblings. As a child, she participated in Girl Scouts[2] and expressed an interest both in space flight and in being a pilot.\n\nAfter graduating from Elmira Free Academy in 1974, Collins attended Corning Community College where she earned an associate degree in mathematics/science in 1976. She graduated from Syracuse University in 1978, then earned a master of science degree in operations research from Stanford University in 1986, and a master of arts degree in space systems management from Webster University in 1989.\n\nAir Force career\nFollowing graduation from Syracuse, she was one of four women chosen for undergraduate pilot training at Vance Air Force Base, Oklahoma. After earning her pilot wings, she stayed on at Vance for three years as a T&#8211;38 Talon instructor pilot before transitioning to the C&#8211;141 Starlifter at Travis Air Force Base, California. From 1986 to 1989, she was assigned to the U.S. Air Force Academy in Colorado, where she was an assistant professor in mathematics and a T&#8211;41 instructor pilot. In 1989, Collins became the second female pilot to attend the U.S. Air Force Test Pilot School and graduated with class 89B. She was selected for the astronaut program in 1990.[3]\n\nCollins married pilot Pat Youngs in 1987; they have two children.[4]\n\nAstronaut\nCollins was selected to be an astronaut in 1992 and first flew the Space Shuttle as pilot in 1995 aboard STS&#8211;63, which involved a rendezvous between Discovery and the Russian space station Mir. In recognition of her achievement as the first female Shuttle Pilot, she received the Harmon Trophy. She was also the pilot for STS&#8211;84 in 1997.\n\n\n\nMission Commander Collins and STS&#8211;114 crew on their way to launch pad.\nCollins was also the first female commander of a U.S. Spacecraft with Shuttle mission STS&#8211;93, launched in July 1999, which deployed the Chandra X&#8211;Ray Observatory.[5][6][7][8]\n\nCollins commanded STS&#8211;114, NASA\'s \"return to flight\" mission to test safety improvements and resupply the International Space Station (ISS). The flight was launched on July 26, 2005, and returned on August 9, 2005. During STS&#8211;114, Collins became the first astronaut to fly the Space Shuttle through a complete 360&#8211;degree pitch maneuver. This was necessary so astronauts aboard the ISS could take photographs of the Shuttle\'s belly, to ensure there was no threat from debris&#8211;related damage to the Shuttle upon reentry.\n\nOn May 1, 2006, Collins announced that she would leave NASA to spend more time with her family and pursue other interests.[9] Since her retirement from NASA, she has made occasional public appearances as an analyst covering Shuttle launches and landings for CNN.\n\nAwards and honors\nCollins has received the Defense Superior Service Medal, Distinguished Flying Cross, Defense Meritorious Service Medal, Meritorious Service Medal with one oak leaf cluster, Air Force Commendation Medal with one oak leaf cluster, Armed Forces Expeditionary Medal for service in Grenada (Operation Urgent Fury), the French Legion of Honor, NASA Outstanding Leadership Medal and NASA Space Flight Medals, the Free Spirit Award, and the 2006 National Space Trophy. Collins also has an astronomical observatory named in her honor—the Eileen M. Collins Observatory—run by Corning Community College.\n\nCollins is an inductee of the National Women\'s Hall Of Fame.[10] She has also been recognized by Encyclopædia Britannica as one of the top 300 women in history who have changed the world.[11]\n\nThe main entrance boulevard to Syracuse Hancock International Airport is named in Collins\' honor.\n\nThe New York State Legislature passed a resolution honoring her career on May 9, 2006. The resolution, which touches on the many highlights of Collins\'s career, reads, in part, \"It is the sense of this Legislative Body to take note of and publicly acknowledge the significant milestones of those individuals from this noble Empire State who have distinguished themselves through their exemplary careers, pioneering spirit and purposeful lives.\" It was sponsored by State Senator George Winner in the State Senate and Assemblyman Thomas F. O\'Mara in the Assembly.\n\nElmira College awarded Eileen Collins an honorary Doctor of Science degree at the college\'s 148th Commencement Ceremony on June 4, 2006.\n\nThe Women\'s Board of the Adler Planetarium awarded Eileen Collins their Women in Space Science Award on June 7, 2006.\n\nUniversity College Dublin conferred on Colonel Collins the honorary Doctor of Science degree of the National University of Ireland on 14 June 2006.[12]\n\nIn 2007, the Space Foundation awarded Collins the Douglas S. Morrow Public Outreach Award,[13] which is given annually to an individual or organization that has made significant contributions to public awareness of space programs.\n\nCollins is also a member of the Air Force Association, Order of Daedalians, Women Military Aviators, U.S. Space Foundation, the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics, and the Ninety&#8211;Nines.\n\n	Wikimedia Commons has media related to Eileen Collins.\nNotes\n	Biography portal\n	United States Air Force portal\n^ Harty, Patricia (2001).

A five&#8211;month NASA investigation fully exonerated Chawla by identifying errors in software interfaces and the defined procedures of flight crew and ground control.\n\nAfter the completion of STS&#8211;87 post&#8211;flight activities, Chawla was assigned to technical positions in the astronaut office to work on the space station, her performance in which was recognized with a special award from her peers.\n\n\n\nChawla in the space shuttle simulator\nIn 2000 she was selected for her second flight as part of the crew of STS&#8211;107. This mission was repeatedly delayed due to scheduling conflicts and technical problems such as the July 2002 discovery of cracks in the shuttle engine flow liners. On January 16, 2003, Chawla finally returned to space aboard Columbia on the ill&#8211;fated STS&#8211;107 mission. Chawla\'s responsibilities included the microgravity experiments, for which the crew conducted nearly 80 experiments studying earth and space science, advanced technology development, and astronaut health and safety.\n\nDeath\nMain article: Space Shuttle Columbia disaster\nChawla died in the Space Shuttle Columbia disaster which occurred on February 1, 2003, when the Space Shuttle disintegrated over Texas during re&#8211;entry into the Earth\'s atmosphere, with the loss of all seven crew members, shortly before it was scheduled to conclude its 28th mission, STS&#8211;107.[10]\n\nAwards\nPosthumously awarded:\n\nCongressional Space Medal of Honor\nNASA Space Flight Medal\nNASA Distinguished Service Medal\nMemorials\nThe Kalpana Chawla ISU Scholarship fund was founded by alumni of the International Space University (ISU) in 2010 to support Indian student participation in international space education programs.[11]\nThe Kalpana Chawla Memorial Scholarship program was instituted by the Indian Students Association (ISA) at the University of Texas at El Paso (UTEP) in 2005 for meritorious graduate students.[12]\nThe Kalpana Chawla Outstanding Recent Alumni Award at the University of Colorado, given since 1983, was renamed for Chawla.[13]\nIn Karnal, Chawla\'s birthplace, at least 30,000 school children and citizens joined hands to make a 36.4&#8211;km&#8211;long human chain to support the demand for a Kalpana Chawla medical college in the city, which was announced by Health Minister of India C.

From 1993 through 1996, Whitson held the additional responsibilities of the Deputy Division Chief of the Medical Sciences Division at NASA&#8211;JSC. From 1995&#8211;1996, she served as Co&#8211;Chair of the U.S.&#8211;Russian Mission Science Working Group.\n\nIn April 1996, Whitson was selected as an astronaut candidate and started training in August 1996. Upon completing the two years of training and evaluation, she was assigned technical duties in the Astronaut Office Operations Planning Branch, and served as the lead for the Crew Test Support Team in Russia from 1998 to 1999. In June 2003, Whitson served as the commander of the NEEMO 5 mission aboard the Aquarius underwater laboratory, living and working underwater for fourteen days.[11] From November 2003 to March 2005, she served as Deputy Chief of the Astronaut Office. From March 2005 to November 2005, she served as Chief of the Station Operations Branch, Astronaut Office. Whitson trained as the backup ISS Commander for Expedition 14 from November 2005 through September 2006, and as the ISS Commander for Expedition 16, launched October 2007, on the Soyuz TMA&#8211;11. During Expedition 16 she surpassed Sunita Williams for woman with the most spacewalks.[1]\n\nWhitson served as Chief of the Astronaut Office until July 2012 and, as such, was responsible for mission preparation activities of International Space Station crews and their support personnel.\n\nSpaceflight experience\n\n\nPeggy Whitson preparing for spacewalk from ISS during Expedition 5.\nExpedition 5\nThe Expedition 5 crew launched on June 5, 2002, aboard STS&#8211;111 and docked with the International Space Station on June 7, 2002. During her six&#8211;month stay aboard the Space Station, Whitson installed the Mobile Base System, the S1 truss segment, and the P1 truss segment using the space station remote manipulator system; performed a 4 hour and 25 minute spacewalk in a Russian Orlan space suit to install micrometeoroid shielding on the Zvezda Service Module; and activated and checked out the Microgravity Sciences Glovebox, a facility class payload rack.\n\nWhitson was named the first NASA Science Officer during her stay, and she conducted 21 investigations in human life sciences and microgravity sciences, as well as commercial payloads.[12] The Expedition 5 crew returned to Earth aboard STS&#8211;113 on December 7, 2002. Completing her first flight, Whitson logged 184 days, 22 hours and 14 minutes in space.\n\nExpedition 16\nHer second mission, Expedition 16, launched October 10, 2007, on Soyuz TMA&#8211;11.[13][14][15] Along with her Expedition 16 crew member Yuri Malenchenko and spaceflight participant Yi So&#8211;yeon, she returned to Earth in Soyuz TMA&#8211;11 on April 19, 2008. The re&#8211;entry was remarkable for the failure of the Soyuz propulsion module to separate properly, and the subsequent \"ballistic reentry\" which subjected the crew to forces about eight times that of gravity.[16] She spent 191 days, 19 hrs and 8 mins in space on this mission.[17]\n\nAwards and honors\nNASA Outstanding Leadership Medal (2006)\nNASA Space Flight Medal (2002)\nPatents awarded (1997, 1998)\nGroup Achievement Award for Shuttle&#8211;Mir Program (1996)\nAmerican Astronautical Society Randolph Lovelace II Award (1995)\nNASA Tech Brief Award (1995)\nNASA Space Act Board Award (1995, 1998)\nNASA Silver Snoopy Award (1995)\nNASA Exceptional Service Medal (1995, 2003, 2006)\nNASA Space Act Award for Patent Application\nNASA Certificate of Commendation (1994)\nNASA Sustained Superior Performance Award (1990)\nMedal \"For Merit in Space Exploration\" (Russia, 12 April 2011) &#8211; for outstanding contribution to the development of international cooperation in manned space flight\nKrug International Merit Award (1989)\nNASA&#8211;JSC National Research Council Resident Research Associate (1986&#8211;1988)\nRobert A.

She earned degrees in physics and electrical engineering from the University of Missouri&#8211;Rolla (now known as the Missouri University of Science and Technology) before earning a PhD in materials science and engineering from the Georgia Institute of Technology in 1996. Research for her dissertation, entitled \"An Investigation of the relationship between the thermochemistry and emission behavior of thermionic cathodes based on the BaO&#8211;Sc2O3&#8211;WO3 ternary system,\" was supported by a fellowship from the NASA Lewis Research Center.[4][2]\n\nEngineering career\nDuring the 1980s, Magnus worked on stealth aircraft design as an engineer for McDonnell Douglas. She worked on the propulsion system for the A&#8211;12 Avenger II until the project was canceled by the Navy in 1991.[2]\n\nNASA career\n\n\nSandra Magnus, STS&#8211;119 mission specialist, exercises on the Cycle Ergometer with Vibration Isolation System (CEVIS) in the Destiny laboratory.\nSTS&#8211;112\nMagnus was selected as an astronaut candidate in 1996 and flew her first space mission, STS&#8211;112, in October 2002 as a mission specialist. The main objective of Space Shuttle Atlantis\' mission was the installation of the S1 truss section on the International Space Station (ISS) and consumables delivery. Magnus operated the space station\'s robotic arm during the three spacewalks required to install and activate the S1 truss. The flight duration was 10 days 19 hours 58 minutes and 44 seconds.\n\nSurvival training\nFrom January 29&#8211;31, 2006, together with Oleg Artemiev and Michael Barratt, Magnus took part in a two&#8211;day examination for the ability to survive in an uninhabited area in case of the Soyuz descent module making an emergency landing. She passed this examination in the forest near Moscow.[5]\n\nNEEMO 11\nFrom September 16&#8211;22, 2006, Magnus served as the commander of NASA\'s NEEMO 11 mission, an undersea expedition at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration\'s Aquarius laboratory located off the coast of Florida. With fellow astronaut/aquanauts Timothy Kopra, Robert Behnken and Timothy Creamer, all of whom were training for possible assignment to missions to the International Space Station, Magnus imitated moonwalks, tested concepts for mobility using various spacesuit configurations and weights to simulate lunar gravity. Techniques for communication, navigation, geological sample retrieval, construction and using remote&#8211;controlled robots on the moon\'s surface also were tested. National Undersea Research Center support crew members Larry Ward and Roger Garcia provided engineering support inside the habitat.[6]\n\nExpedition 18\nMagnus served as Flight Engineer on board the International Space Station as part of Expedition 18.[2] Magnus was a Mission Specialist on STS&#8211;126 for the trip to the station, which launched on November 14, 2008.[7] She served as Mission Specialist on STS&#8211;119 when it returned on March 28, 2009.[2][8] She logged 133 days in orbit and received warm greetings from NASA on her return. Her replacement, JAXA astronaut Koichi Wakata, was launched aboard Discovery on March 15, 2009.[3]\n\nSTS&#8211;135\n\n\nMagnus in the Cupola aboard the International Space Station during STS&#8211;135.\nOn September 14, 2010, NASA announced Magnus to be one of four astronauts assigned to the STS&#8211;135 \"launch on need\" crew that was, if needed, to fly a rescue mission for STS&#8211;134, which was originally the last scheduled shuttle flight.[9] Other members assigned to that crew were commander Christopher Ferguson, pilot Douglas G. Hurley, and fellow mission specialist Rex J. Walheim. In January 2011, NASA added STS&#8211;135 to the manifest as the final space shuttle mission, scheduled to launch in July 2011; STS&#8211;134 was conducted successfully in May 2011, requiring no rescue flight. The mission launched successfully on 8 July 2011 and landed on July 21.\n\nReferences\n This article incorporates public domain material from websites or documents of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration.\n\n^ Astronauts and Cosmonauts (sorted by \"Time in Space\")\n^ to: a b c d e \"Sandra H.

<string name="Lisa_Nowak">Lisa Marie Nowak (née Caputo) (born May 10, 1963) is a former American naval flight officer and NASA astronaut. Born in Washington, D.C., she was selected by NASA in 1996 and qualified as a mission specialist in robotics. Nowak flew aboard Space Shuttle Discovery during the STS&#8211;121 mission in July 2006, where she was responsible for operating the robotic arms of the shuttle and the International Space Station.\n\nNowak gained international attention on February 5, 2007, when she was arrested in Orlando, Florida, and subsequently charged with the attempted kidnapping of U.S. Air Force Captain Colleen Shipman, who was romantically involved with astronaut William Oefelein. Nowak was released on bail, and initially pleaded not guilty to the charges, which included attempted kidnapping, burglary with assault, and battery. Her assignment to the space agency as an astronaut was terminated by NASA effective March 8, 2007. On November 10, 2009, Nowak agreed to a plea deal with prosecutors and pleaded guilty to charges of felony burglary of a car and misdemeanor battery. The episode \"Rocket Man\" of the police procedural Law and Order: Criminal Intent was loosely based on this incident, and is also referenced in the Ben Folds song Cologne.\n\nNowak remained a Navy Captain until August 2010, when a naval board of inquiry, composed of three admirals, voted unanimously to reduce Nowak in rank to Commander and to discharge her from the Navy under other than honorable conditions.[1]\n\nContents  [hide] \n1 Early life and education\n2 Military career\n3 NASA career\n4 After NASA\n5 Personal\n6 Charges of attempted kidnapping at Orlando Airport\n6.1 Arraignment\n6.2 Reactions\n6.3 Evidence released before trial\n6.4 Developments in case\n7 References\n8 Further reading\n9 External links\nEarly life and education\nLisa Nowak is the daughter of Alfredo and Jane Caputo of Rockville, Maryland.[2] She first became interested in the space program when she was six years old, watching the Apollo moon landings. Nowak followed the Space Shuttle program, particularly the introduction of female astronauts, while she was growing up. She graduated from Charles W. Woodward High School in Rockville, Maryland, in 1981, and received her Bachelor of Science degree in aerospace engineering from the United States Naval Academy in 1985.[2] Nowak earned a Master of Science degree in aeronautical engineering, and a degree in aeronautical and astronautical engineering in 1992 from the U.S. Naval Postgraduate School in Monterey, California.[2]\n\nMilitary career\nNowak received her commission in the United States Navy in 1985. In 1987, she became a Naval Flight Officer via the Tactical Navigation syllabus at Training Squadron 86 (VT&#8211;86) at NAS Pensacola, Florida. Nowak was then assigned to Electronic Warfare Aggressor Squadron 34 (VAQ&#8211;34) at NAS Point Mugu, California, where she flew both the EA&#8211;7L and ERA&#8211;3B aircraft, supporting the U.S. Pacific Fleet in small and large&#8211;scale exercises with jamming and missile profiles.[2] In 1993, she was selected for transfer to the Restricted Line as an Aerospace Engineering Duty Officer, and to attend the U.S. Naval Test Pilot School at NAS Patuxent River, Maryland.[2] After graduating from the Naval Postgraduate School, Nowak stayed at Patuxent River working as an aircraft systems project officer at the Air Combat Environment Test and Evaluation Facility and at Strike Aircraft Test Squadron, flying in the F/A&#8211;18 and EA&#8211;6B. Nowak was then assigned to the Naval Air Systems Command, working on acquisition of new systems for naval aircraft, when she was selected for the astronaut program.[2] She logged over 1,500 hours of flight in over 30 different aircraft during her career in the Navy.[2] On August 20, 2010, a panel of three U.S. Navy admirals recommended that she be discharged from the Navy and her rank reduced from Captain to Commander. Her service was classified as \"other than honorable.\"[3]\n\nWhile in the Navy, Nowak was awarded the Defense Meritorious Service Medal, the Navy Commendation Medal, the Navy Achievement Medal, and other service awards.[2]\n\nNASA career\n\n\nLisa Nowak during astronaut training in 2005.\nNowak was selected to be an astronaut in 1996 and entered the NASA Astronaut Corps at Johnson Space Center in August of that year.[2] She qualified as a mission specialist in robotics, and was assigned to a future mission designated STS&#8211;118. After schedule changes, she instead went into space on July 4, 2006, as a member of the STS&#8211;121 crew assigned to the International Space Station. Nowak served as mission flight engineer, operated the Shuttle\'s robotic arm during several spacewalks, and logged almost 13 days in space.[2]\n\nOn February 6, 2007, following an arrest in Florida for attempted kidnapping, Nowak was placed on 30&#8211;day leave by NASA.[4] She returned to Houston, Texas, on a commercial airline flight the next day and upon arrival was reportedly taken immediately under police escort to the Johnson Space Center for medical and psychiatric evaluation. Nowak\'s assignment to NASA as a serving Navy officer was terminated by the space agency on March 7, 2007.[4][5][6]\n\nAfter NASA\nOn June 5, 2007, Nowak was awarded the NASA Space Flight Medal at Johnson Space Center.[7]\n\nNowak remained on active duty with the Navy and was subsequently ordered to work on the staff of the chief of Naval Air Training at Naval Air Station Corpus Christi, Texas. There, she was involved in the development of flight training curricula for broad use throughout the Navy.[8] Naval officials waited for her kidnapping case to be resolved before taking further action against her.[9] Military law experts state that while the Navy rarely brings charges against officers for adultery, it is seen as conduct unbecoming an officer, as it demonstrates bad judgment.[10]\n\nNowak\'s state of mind during the incident is the subject of a play, Starcrosser\'s Cut, that opened in Los Angeles in June 2013.[11]\n\nPersonal\nNowak married Richard T. Nowak, a classmate at both the Naval Academy and naval flight school, in 1988.[12] Richard Nowak was employed by a contractor to NASA at Johnson Space Center.[13] The Nowaks have three children, a son born in 1992 and twin daughters born in 2001.[14] A statement from the family indicated that the Nowaks separated in January 2007[15] and subsequently divorced.[16]\n\nImmediately following William Oefelein\'s divorce, he and Lisa Nowak became involved with each other. Their affair lasted two years, with Oefelein beginning to break it off gradually near the end of 2006. It was during this time that Oefelein started a relationship with Colleen Shipman, who was working as an engineer with the 45th Space Wing at Patrick Air Force Base, Florida.[17][18][19]\n\nCharges of attempted kidnapping at Orlando Airport\nNowak drove from Houston to Orlando, Florida, on February 4&#8211;5, 2007. She packed latex gloves, a black wig, a BB pistol and ammunition, pepper spray, a hooded tan trench coat, a 2&#8211;pound drilling hammer, black gloves, rubber tubing, plastic garbage bags, approximately $585 (USD) in cash, her computer, an 8&#8211;inch (20 cm) Gerber folding knife and several other items before driving the 900 miles (1,400 km) to Florida. Early police reports indicated she wore space diapers during the trip, but she later denied wearing them.[20][21] On February 5, 2007, Nowak went to the Orlando International Airport, waited for about an hour in the baggage claim, and then proceeded to the airport parking lot, where she located and confronted Shipman, who had just arrived from Houston by plane.[22]\n\nShipman said that after arriving, she was aware of someone following her to an airport satellite parking area.[23] When she got into her car, she heard running footsteps and quickly locked the door. Nowak slapped the window and tried to open the car door, asked for a ride, then started crying. Shipman rolled down the window a couple of inches after which Nowak sprayed the pepper spray into the car. Shipman drove off to the parking lot booth where police were summoned. Several Orlando Police Department officers arrived minutes later, with the first officer observing Nowak throwing a bag into the trash at a parking shuttle bus stop. Nowak was subsequently arrested at Orlando International Airport on charges of attempted kidnapping, battery, attempted vehicle burglary with battery, and destruction of evidence.[24][25][26][27] In a handwritten request for a restraining order against Nowak after her arrest, Shipman referred to Nowak as an acquaintance of a boyfriend but did not identify Oefelein, and also claimed Nowak had been stalking her for two months.[28] Nowak told investigators she was involved in a relationship with Oefelein which she described as being \"more than a working relationship but less than a romantic relationship.\" Citing evidence of elaborate planning, disguises and weapons, police recommended she be held without bail.[28][29][30]\n\nArraignment\nTwo fellow astronauts traveled to Florida for Nowak\'s arraignment to assist authorities and NASA personnel as needed:[31] Christopher Ferguson, the senior Naval Officer in the NASA Astronaut Corps, went as Nowak\'s commanding officer, and retired Air Force Colonel Steven Lindsey, who was the commander of Nowak\'s shuttle mission, STS&#8211;121, went as Chief of the Astronaut Office, the senior astronaut at NASA. On February 6, 2007, both appeared before a judge on her behalf. The state\'s attorney argued that the facts indicated a well thought out plan to kidnap and perhaps to injure Shipman.[24] While arguing for pre&#8211;trial release Nowak\'s attorney remarked, “One’s good works must count for something.” Nowak was ordered released on $15,500 bail under the condition she wear a GPS tracking device and not contact Shipman.[32] Before Nowak could be released, however, Orlando police charged Nowak with attempted first degree murder and announced she would not be released on bail. Her lawyer alleged that police and prosecutors, unhappy that Nowak had been granted bail, pressed more serious charges solely to keep her confined to jail.[33] In the second arraignment Nowak was charged with attempted first degree murder with a deadly weapon, for which the judge raised bail by $10,000. After posting bail, Nowak was released from jail.[29] Shipman dropped her request for a protection order on February 15.[34]\n\nReactions\nThere was widespread reaction to Nowak\'s arrest with concerns expressed about NASA\'s astronaut selection and screening process and planned 30&#8211;month missions to Mars.[35][36] Some indicated that NASA\'s presentation of astronauts as heroes is part of the problem because of the social pressure.[37] Some perceived her treatment in the criminal process as lenient.[38] Others have been shocked that her misfortunes have been the subject of parody.[39][40][41]\n\nNASA Administrator Michael D. Griffin commissioned the NASA Astronaut Health Care System Review Committee, an independent panel, to examine how well NASA attended to the mental health of its astronauts. The initial report released by the panel raised questions in regards to possible alcohol use prior to flight.[42] The report, however, offered no specifics, no facts to substantiate the claims, and stated that no attempt to confirm or investigate the allegations had been performed.[43][44][45]\n\nShuttle Commander Scott Kelly was vocal in his criticism of the report during interviews prior to STS&#8211;118, stating it was beyond his comprehension that astronauts would ever consider what was suggested.[44] Following the release of the independent panel report, NASA ordered an internal review, The Space Flight Safety Review.[45]\n\nOn August 29, 2007, Chief Safety and Mission Assurance Officer Bryan O\'Connor reported that after the month&#8211;long review, NASA found there was no evidence to verify the independent panel\'s report that astronauts have been allowed to fly drunk.[43][46][47] Additionally, investigation into all incident reports dating from 1984 to 2007, found no incident involving alcohol or drug use.[48] The report\'s findings specifically stated:\n\nThe culture of professionalism in today\'s astronaut corps, along with the highly visible, structured and supervised schedule during the last several days prior to launch, provide reasonable controls to avoid flying an alcohol&#8211;impaired crewmember. In light of all the other controls in place on launch day, the L&#8211;0 flight surgeon check provides a reasonable likelihood of identifying signs of illness or impairment of the level that would threaten flight safety.[48]\n\nIn response to the internal review, policies at NASA would be changed in a variety of ways: flight surgeons would be present during the pre&#8211;mission suit&#8211;up activities, flight surgeons would receive additional training in psychiatric evaluation, and although there was an unofficial code of conduct in place, an official \"Code of Conduct\" would be written up for employees.[48]\n\nEvidence released before trial\nOn April 10, 2007, Florida prosecutors released additional material in the case. The previous week, the trial judge had agreed to unseal some of the documents that described items found in Nowak\'s car after her arrest. Among these items were a handwritten note on USS Nimitz stationery listing Shipman\'s flight information and \"Flight Controller\'s Log\" paper with a handwritten list of more than 24 items, including sneakers, plastic gloves, contacts, cash, an umbrella, and black sweats. A floppy disk contained two photographs of Nowak riding in a bicycle race, and fifteen images depicting an unidentified woman in different stages of undress. An evidence report dated March 15 indicated that nearly all of the photographs and drawings depicted scenes of bondage.[49] Also found was $585.00 (USD), and £41.00 (GBP) in cash, and four brown paper bags with 69 orange pills that were not publicly identified. Investigators also examined two USB drives found in the car. They contained family pictures, digital movies, and NASA&#8211;related materials. Investigators concluded that the information on the disk and USB drives did not have any direct relationship to the alleged kidnapping attempt.[50]\n\nOefelein reportedly provided Nowak with a cell phone to communicate with him. Phone records show that she called him at least 12 times, and sent 7 text messages the day after he returned from his shuttle flight on December 22 that he did not retrieve until December 24 when they had a 7&#8211;minute conversation. During December and January, over 100 calls were recorded, although it is unclear who called whom. Under questioning by NASA and military investigators, Oefelein reportedly stated that he had broken off the relationship with Nowak. He did, however, have her to lunch in his apartment at least once in January, they continued to train together for a bicycle race, and they also went to the gym together.[51][52]\n\nOn May 11, 2007, authorities released a surveillance video from the Orlando International Airport terminal purporting to show Nowak waiting for nearly an hour, standing near the baggage claim, then donning a trench coat and later following Shipman after she retrieved her bags.[53]\n\nDevelopments in case\nOn February 13, 2007, Nowak pled not guilty to the charges of attempted murder and attempted kidnapping. On March 2, Florida prosecutors filed three formal charges against Nowak: (1) attempted kidnapping with intent to inflict bodily harm or terrorize, (2) burglary of a conveyance with a weapon, and (3) battery.[54] The prosecutors declined to file the attempted murder charge that had been recommended by Orlando police. Nowak formally entered a plea of not guilty to the kidnapping charges on March 22 at an arraignment hearing although she was not present in person. Nowak\'s attorney, who filed the plea with the Orange County court, requested a jury trial. The trial was originally due to commence on July 30, 2007, but was postponed until April 7, 2008, to allow the prosecution time to prepare for an anticipated insanity defense. On January 16, 2008, a judge postponed the trial, as well as the pre&#8211;trial hearing to be held on March 12, 2008, indefinitely, pending the outcome of the state\'s appeal of an earlier decision to suppress evidence obtained on the day of her arrest.[55][56]\n\nA pre&#8211;trial hearing was held on July 17, 2007, and further hearings were to be held on September 19, to argue defense motions to suppress some of the evidence obtained on the day of her arrest.[51][57][58] On August 12, 2007, Nowak asked to have her GPS ankle bracelet removed,[59] which the judge agreed to on August 30.[60] On August 28, the trial judge unsealed a court document indicating that Nowak intended to pursue an insanity defense. Her lawyer stated that she suffered from major depression, obsessive&#8211;compulsive disorder, insomnia, and \"brief psychotic disorder with marked stressors\" at the time of the incident.[61] On November 2, 2007, the trial judge suppressed Nowak\'s initial (pre&#8211;Miranda) statements to police, as well as all evidence found in her vehicle, citing police misconduct in their initial search and questioning.[62] The prosecution appealed that ruling on November 8. A hearing on that appeal occurred on October 21, 2008.[63][64][65]\n\nOn December 5, 2008, the Fifth District Court of Appeals for the State of Florida held that her statements were taken in violation of her Miranda rights, but that the search of her car was still valid under the inevitable discovery exception to the search warrant requirement because the police would have inevitably found it in the normal course of the investigation despite her illegal statement. The case was sent back for trial. A pre&#8211;trial status hearing was scheduled for June 22, 2009. On April 1, 2009, the judge ordered Nowak to undergo two psychiatric evaluations before June 12, 2009.[66][67]\n\nOn May 15, 2009, it was reported that Nowak would not claim insanity if her case ever went to trial. Nowak\'s attorney withdrew a previous motion filed in 2007, which would have left open the opportunity to use an insanity defense in the case.[16] On October 7, 2009, a judge in Orlando ruled in favor of allowing Nowak\'s attorneys to take a second deposition from Shipman to inquire whether Nowak actually pepper&#8211;sprayed Shipman. A medical report by paramedics raised some questions according to Nowak\'s attorneys as to the factual basis for it. If it was found not to have occurred, Nowak\'s attorneys wanted the criminal charges related to the assault and battery to be dropped before trial begins. The trial was scheduled for December 7, 2009. On November 10, 2009, Nowak entered a guilty plea to lesser charges. She was sentenced to a year\'s probation and the two days already served in jail, with no additional jail time.[24][68][69][70][71]\n\nOn August 19, 2010, a Naval administrative panel of three admirals voted to recommend Nowak be separated from the U.S. Navy with an \"other than honorable\" discharge and that her rank be reduced from Captain to Commander.[72] The panel\'s recommendation will be reviewed by the Naval Personnel Command and will ultimately be determined by the Secretary of the Navy.[72]\n\nIn March 2011, Nowak petitioned the court to seal the record of her criminal proceedings, citing harm to her family and their livelihood.[73] On July 28, 2011, Assistant Secretary of Navy Juan M. Garcia III said in a statement that Nowak would retire with an \"other than honorable\" discharge and her pay grade would be knocked down one rank.[74]\n\nReferences\n^ \"Navy to discharge ex&#8211;astronaut in stalking case\".

Her father, Michael (Mykhailo) Stefanyshyn, now deceased, was born in the Halychyna region of Ukraine, and sent to work in Germany during World War II.[2] After the end of the war, he married a German woman and they both immigrated to the U.S.[2] Stefanyshyn&#8211;Piper\'s mother, Adelheid Stefanyshyn, still lives in St. Paul.[1] Stefanyshyn&#8211;Piper was raised in the Ukrainian cultural community of Minneapolis&#8211;Saint Paul, and speaks the Ukrainian language.[2]\n\nStefanyshyn&#8211;Piper graduated in 1980 from what was then the all&#8211;girls Derham Hall High School in St. Paul, Minnesota, and holds Bachelor of Science (1984) and Master of Science (1985) degrees in mechanical engineering from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). She is a licensed ham radio operator with Technician License KD5TVR.[3][4]\n\nStefanyshyn&#8211;Piper married Glenn A. Piper,[when?] and they have one son, Michael, named after Piper\'s grandfather.[2] Stefanyshyn&#8211;Piper hyphenated her surname after marriage to serve as a reminder of her family roots.[2]\n\nMilitary career\nStefanyshyn&#8211;Piper received her commission from the Naval ROTC Program at MIT in June 1985.[1] She completed training at the Naval Diving and Salvage Training Center in Panama City, Florida as a Navy Basic Diving Officer and Salvage Officer.[1] During her Salvage tour, she participated in the de&#8211;stranding of the tanker Exxon Houston off the coast of Barbers Point in Hawaii.[1] Stefanyshyn&#8211;Piper is currently a Captain in the United States Navy.[1]\n\nDuring her military career she was awarded: Defense Superior Service Medal, 2 Legion of Merit, Defense Meritorious Service Medal, Meritorious Service Medal, 2 Navy Commendation Medals, 2 Navy Achievement Medals, and other service medals.\n\nNASA career\nSelected as an astronaut candidate by NASA in April 1996, Stefanyshyn&#8211;Piper reported to the Johnson Space Center in August 1996. After two years of training and evaluation, she qualified for flight assignment as a mission specialist. Initially assigned to astronaut support duties for launch and landing, she has also served as lead Astronaut Office Representative for Payloads and in the Astronaut Office EVA branch.[1]\n\nSTS&#8211;115 &#8211; Atlantis (September 9&#8211;21, 2006)\n\n\nSTS&#8211;115 crew\nMain article: STS&#8211;115\nStefanyshyn&#8211;Piper flew her first mission on STS&#8211;115, aboard Space Shuttle Atlantis (launched September 9, 2006, and returned September 21), as a Mission Specialist and became only the 8th woman to perform a spacewalk (out of 180 total spacewalkers). Stefanyshyn&#8211;Piper participated in two of the mission\'s three EVAs for a total of 12 hours, 8 minutes made her the second most experienced female spacewalker. She also became the first Minnesota woman to go into space.[5] She also was the first person to faint twice before a public audience while trying to confess that she had witnessed an unknown phenomenon outside the shuttle, without being able to describe precisely what it was.[dubious &#8211; discuss]\n\nEVA One (Duration 5 hours, 26 minutes) &#8211;&#8211; With astronaut Joe Tanner, Stefanyshyn&#8211;Piper conducted initial installation of the P3/P4 truss onto the space station. Connected power cables on the truss, released the launch restraints on the solar array blanket box, the Beta Gimbal Assembly, and the solar array wings. Configured the Solar Alpha Rotary Joint (SARJ), and removed two circuit interrupt devices to prepare for STS&#8211;116. Stefanyshyn&#8211;Piper became the seventh American woman to conduct a spacewalk.[6]\nEVA Three (Duration 6 hours, 42 minutes) &#8211;&#8211; With astronaut Joe Tanner, Stefanyshyn&#8211;Piper installed a radiator onto the P3/4 truss, powered up a cooling radiator for the new solar arrays, replaced an S&#8211;Band radio antenna, and installed insulation for another antenna. Tanner took photos of the shuttle’s wings using an infrared camera to test the camera\'s ability to detect damage.[7]\nDuring her pre&#8211;flight interview, she described her philosophy about human exploration of space:\n\n“	To me exploring space is just a natural progression of, where humans are going. As we become more advanced and we have more technology to go farther. Thousands of years ago people would just go beyond the next hill, go over the mountain, go across the river. Then it led to going across the oceans. And, then it was \"OK, let\'s go into the skies.\" We now have airplanes. We can fly. We have submarines and submersibles; we can go into the waters. So looking into the skies and looking at the stars and at the planets and thinking, what\'s out there... We\'re curious. We, as humans always want to know what\'s out there. To me it, it just seems natural that we\'ve looked around here and we\'re just going to go look out farther. We\'re still developing the means to go out there farther. But that\'s just where we\'re going to go next. To me, exploration makes sense because we\'re always looking at what\'s the next thing out there &#8211;&#8211; what else can we learn, and how can we go there. Maybe we can learn something that we can bring back here and help solve some of the problems we have on Earth.[8]	”\nNEEMO 12 (May 7&#8211;18, 2007)\n\n\nThe NEEMO 12 crew. L&#8211;R: Josef Schmid, Stefanyshyn&#8211;Piper, James Talacek, Dominic Landucci, José Hernández and Timothy J. Broderick.\nStefanyshyn&#8211;Piper was commander of the 12th expedition of NASA Extreme Environment Mission Operations (NEEMO), a NASA program for studying human survival in the Aquarius underwater laboratory in preparation for future space exploration.[9][10][11][12][13]\n\nSTS&#8211;126 &#8211; Endeavour (November 14&#8211;30, 2008)\nMain article: STS&#8211;126\nStefanyshyn&#8211;Piper flew as a Mission Specialist on STS&#8211;126, aboard Space Shuttle Endeavour (launched November 14, 2008, and returned November 30), during which she participated in and was Lead Spacewalker on three of four spacewalks. The mission ended when Endeavour landed successfully at Edwards Air Force Base, California. Following Stefanyshyn&#8211;Piper\'s third spacewalk during STS&#8211;126, her fifth overall, her total time in EVA became 33 hours, 42 minutes, putting her in twenty&#8211;fifth place for total time in EVA.[14]\n\n\n\nSTS&#8211;126 crew\nEVA One (Duration 6 hours, 52 minutes) &#8211;&#8211; With astronaut Stephen G. Bowen, Stefanyshyn&#8211;Piper transferred an empty nitrogen tank assembly from ESP3 to the shuttle’s cargo bay, transferred a new flex hose rotary coupler to ESP3 for future use, removed an insulation cover on the Kibo External Facility berthing mechanism, began cleaning and lubrication of the starboard SARJ, and replacement of its 11 trundle bearing assemblies.[15][16]\nEVA Two (Duration 6 hours, 45 minutes) &#8211;&#8211; With astronaut Robert S. Kimbrough, Stefanyshyn&#8211;Piper relocated the two Crew and Equipment Translation Aid (CETA) carts from the starboard side of the Mobile Transporter to the port side, lubricated the station robotic arm’s latching end effector A snare bearings, continued cleaning and lubrication of the starboard SARJ. EVA was conducted on the station\'s tenth year anniversary.[17][18][19]\nEVA Three (Duration 6 hours, 57 minutes) &#8211;&#8211; With astronaut Stephen G. Bowen, Stefanyshyn&#8211;Piper completed cleaning and lubrication of all but one of the trundle bearing assemblies (TBA) on the starboard SARJ. The final TBA was replaced during EVA 4.[14][20]\nLost tool bag during spacewalk\n\n\nStefanyshyn&#8211;Piper (left) and Shane Kimbrough, STS&#8211;126 mission specialists, in the mission\'s second scheduled session of EVA on the International Space Station\nDuring the first EVA of STS&#8211;126 on November 18, 2008, as Stefanyshyn&#8211;Piper was preparing to begin work on the Solar Alpha Rotary Joint, she noticed a significant amount of grease in her tool bag. \"I think we had a grease gun explode in the large bag, because there\'s grease in the bag,\" Stefanyshyn&#8211;Piper reported to Kimbrough, who was working inside the shuttle to help coordinate the EVA.[15][16] Mission Control managers instructed Stefanyshyn&#8211;Piper to clean up the grease using a dry wipe, and while she was doing the cleanup, she accidentally pushed aside the bag. \"I guess one of my crew lock bags was not transferred and it\'s loose,\" Stefanyshyn&#8211;Piper told Kimbrough.[16] The bag floated aft and starboard of the station, and did not pose a risk to the station or orbiter. The bag and its contents entered Low Earth Orbit as space debris, where it eventually burned&#8211;up as it entered the Earth\'s atmosphere west of Mexico on August 3, 2009.[21][22] When in orbit, it was visible from the ground using a telescope.[23]\n\nAfter taking an inventory of the items inside the lost bag, managers on the ground determined that Bowen had all those items in his bag, and the two could share equipment.[16] While it extended the EVA duration slightly, the major objectives were not changed.[15][16] The estimated value of the equipment lost is US$100,000.[24]\n\nDuring the Mission Status Briefing, lead International Space Station Flight Director Ginger Kerrick said that there was no way to know what caused the bag to come loose.[25] \"We don\'t know that this incident occurred because they forgot to tether something. We don\'t know if perhaps the hook just came loose inside the bag,\" Kerrick said. \"You\'ve got to remember, we are working with humans here and we are prone to human error. We do the best we can, and we learn from our mistakes.\"[25] Said Stefanyshyn&#8211;Piper of the incident, \"that definitely was not the high point of the EVA. It was very disheartening to watch it float away.\"\n\nRetirement from NASA\nIn July 2009, Stefanyshyn&#8211;Piper retired from NASA\'s Astronaut Corps to return to her Navy duties.[22]\n\nFellow astronaut Steven Lindsey, Chief of the Astronaut Office at the Johnson Space Center in Houston, stated on her retirement: \"Heide has been an outstanding astronaut, contributing significantly to the Space Shuttle and Space Station programs. In particular, her superb leadership as lead spacewalker during the STS&#8211;126 mission resulted in restoring full power generation capability to the International Space Station. We wish her the best of luck back in the Navy &#8211; she will be missed.\"[26] She was awarded two NASA Space Flight Medals, and the NASA Exceptional Service Medal.\n\nIn August 2009, Stefanyshyn&#8211;Piper reported to the Naval Sea Systems Command as the Chief Technology Officer.\n\nCommanding the NSWCCD\nOn May 20, 2011 Captain Stefanyshyn&#8211;Piper became commander of the Carderock Division of the Naval Surface Warfare Center in Maryland.[27]\n\nReferences\n This article incorporates public domain material from websites or documents of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration.\n\n^ to: a b c d e f g NASA. \"Heidemarie Stefanyshyn&#8211;Piper\".

<string name="Anousheh_Ansari">Anousheh Ansari (Persian: انوشه انصاری‎; née Raissyan;[4] born September 12, 1966, in Mashhad, Iran) is an Iranian&#8211;American engineer and co&#8211;founder and chairwoman of Prodea Systems. Her previous business accomplishments include serving as co&#8211;founder and CEO of Telecom Technologies, Inc. (TTI). The Ansari family is also the title sponsor of the Ansari X Prize. On September 18, 2006, a few days after her 40th birthday, she became the first Iranian in space.[5] Ansari was the fourth overall self&#8211;funded space tourist, and the first self&#8211;funded woman to fly to the International Space Station. Her memoir, My Dream of Stars, co&#8211;written with Homer Hickam, was published by Palgrave Macmillan in 2010.[6]\n\nContents  [hide] \n1 Early life\n2 Business career\n3 Space\n3.1 Spaceflight\n3.2 Iranian flag controversy\n3.3 Reactions to Ansari\'s flight\n3.3.1 Crewmates\n3.3.2 Reactions in Iran\n3.4 Interviews\n4 Honors and awards\n5 See also\n6 References\n7 External links\nEarly life\nAnousheh Ansari was born in Mashhad, Iran. She and her parents moved to Tehran shortly afterward.[7] Anousheh is Muslim,[2][3] she witnessed the Iranian Revolution in 1979. She immigrated to the United States in 1984 as a teenager.[8] Apart from her native Persian, she is fluent in English and French, and acquired a working knowledge of Russian for her spaceflight experience.[9]\n\nShe received her Bachelor of Science degree in electrical engineering and computer science at George Mason University in Fairfax, Virginia, and her master\'s degree at George Washington University in Washington D.C.[5][10][11]\n\nAfter graduation, Anousheh began work at MCI, where she met her future husband, Hamid Ansari. They married in 1991.[12]\n\nAnsari resides in Plano, Texas.\n\nBusiness career\nIn 1993, she persuaded her husband, Hamid Ansari, and her brother&#8211;in&#8211;law, Amir Ansari, to co&#8211;found Telecom Technologies Inc, using their savings and corporate retirement accounts, as a wave of deregulation hit the telecommunications industry.[citation needed] The company was a supplier of softswitch technology that enabled telecom \"service providers to enhance system performance, lower operating costs and furnish new revenue opportunities.\" The company, headquartered in Richardson, Texas, offered a line of products that allowed for integration between existing legacy telecom networks and application&#8211;centric, next&#8211;generation networks via software switch technology.[13] telecom technologies was acquired by Sonus Networks, Inc. in 2001 in a stock&#8211;for&#8211;stock transaction for 10.8 million shares of Sonus stock. Anousheh Ansari became \"a vice president of Sonus and general manager of Sonus\' new INtelligentIP division.\"[14] As of March 2001, she remained in that position.[15][dated info]\n\nIn 2006, she co&#8211;founded Prodea Systems, and is the current chairman and CEO.[16]\n\nSpace\n\n\nAnsari has expressed that she does not consider herself a \"space tourist\", and prefers the title of \"spaceflight participant\".[17]\n\nAnsari is a member of the X PRIZE Foundation’s Vision Circle, as well as its Board of Trustees.[18] Along with her brother&#8211;in&#8211;law, Amir Ansari, she made a multi&#8211;million dollar contribution to the X PRIZE foundation on May 5, 2004, the 43rd anniversary of Alan Shepard\'s sub&#8211;orbital spaceflight. The X PRIZE was officially renamed the Ansari X PRIZE in honor of their donation. As demonstrated by her commitment to the X PRIZE and through presentations at Space Enthusiast conferences, Ansari is a spokes&#8211;person for the \"privatization of space\", a process enabling commercially viable companies to government&#8211;independently send equipment and/or people into space for exploration and other purposes.[19]\n\nThe Ansari family investment firm, also named Prodea, has announced a partnership with Space Adventures, Ltd. and the Federal Space Agency of the Russian Federation (FSA) to create a fleet of suborbital spaceflight vehicles (the Space Adventures Explorer) for global commercial use.[20]\n\nSpaceflight\nAnsari trained as a backup for Daisuke Enomoto for a Soyuz flight to the International Space Station, through Space Adventures, Ltd.[21] On August 21, 2006, Enomoto was medically disqualified from flying the Soyuz TMA&#8211;9 mission that was due to launch the following month. The next day Ansari was elevated to the prime crew.[22][23]\n\n\n\nAnsari holds a plant grown in the Zvezda Service Module of the International Space Station.\nAsked what she hoped to achieve on her spaceflight, Ansari said, \"I hope to inspire everyone—especially young people, women, and young girls all over the world, and in Middle Eastern countries that do not provide women with the same opportunities as men—to not give up their dreams and to pursue them...It may seem impossible to them at times. But I believe they can realize their dreams if they keep it in their hearts, nurture it, and look for opportunities and make those opportunities happen.\"[24] The day before her departure, she was interviewed on Iran national television for the astronomy show Night\'s Sky.[25] The hosts wished her success and thanked her on behalf of Iranians. Ansari in return, thanked them.[26]\n\nAnsari lifted off on the Soyuz TMA&#8211;9 mission with commander Mikhail Tyurin (RSA) and flight engineer Michael Lopez&#8211;Alegria (NASA) at 04:59 (UTC) on Monday September 18, 2006, from Baikonur, Kazakhstan. Ansari became the fourth (and first female) space tourist. Her contract did not allow for disclosure of the amount paid, but previous space tourists have paid in excess of $20 million USD. The space craft docked with the International Space Station (ISS) on Wednesday September 20, 2006, at 05:21 (UTC).[27][28] Ansari landed safely aboard Soyuz TMA&#8211;8 on September 29, 2006, at 01:13 UTC on the steppes of Kazakhstan (90 kilometers north of Arkalyk) with U.S. astronaut Jeffrey Williams and Russian cosmonaut Pavel Vinogradov.[29] She was given red roses from an unidentified official, and a surprise kiss from her husband, Hamid.[30][31] Rescuers moved them to Kustanai for welcome ceremony with helicopters.[32][33]\n\nDuring her eight day[citation needed] stay on board the International Space Station, Ansari agreed to perform a series of experiments on behalf of the European Space Agency. She conducted four experiments,[34] including:\n\nResearching the mechanisms behind anemia.\nHow changes in muscles influence lower back pain.\nConsequences of space radiation on ISS crew members and different species of microbes that have made a home for themselves on the space station.\nShe also became the first person to publish a weblog from space.\n\nIranian flag controversy\n\n\nAnousheh Ansari\'s official space flight patch, featuring both the flags of Iran (lower right) and the U.S. (lower left), the ISS icon, and the map of Iran marked in dark green on the Earth\'s surface.\nAnsari intended to wear the U.S. flag on her spacesuit alongside with a politically neutral version of the Iranian flag, i.e. the simple 3&#8211;color flag with no government&#8211;specific emblem, to honor the two countries that have contributed to her life.[35] A few U.S.&#8211;based media wrongly speculated that she was intending to wear the version of the Iranian flag that predated the 1979 Islamic revolution in Iran.[4]\n\nAt the insistence of the NASA and Russian officials, she did not wear the Iranian flag officially, but wore the Iranian flag colors instead and kept the Iranian flag on her official flight patch.[36] She and her husband said no political message was intended, despite the increasing tensions with United States and Iran relations, which had dominated world headlines in the weeks leading up to her launch. She noted that she had \"plans to devote her mission to expanding a global consciousness she expected would be seeded with her first look at Earth from space\".\n\nReactions to Ansari\'s flight\nCrewmates\nMichael Lopez&#8211;Alegria, the Spanish&#8211;born NASA astronaut who flew on the Russian Soyuz spacecraft on the return flight with Ansari, expressed his doubts to reporters before the flight: \"I\'m not a big fan personally of having those guys go visit the space station because I think the space station is still a place that is under construction, and not quite operational. I don\'t think it\'s ideal.\"[37]\n\nLopez&#8211;Alegria later stated that he was skeptical of private tourists a few years ago, but now believes it is essential to the survival of the Russian space program which is important to the U.S. space program: \"If that\'s the correct solution... then not only is it good from the standpoint of supporting the Russian space program, but it\'s good for us as well,\" he said. Ansari\'s presence in space \"is a great dream and a great hope not just for our country but for countries all around the world.\"[38]\n\nThe same Associated Press story also quoted Mikhail Tyurin describing Ansari as \"very professional\" and said he felt like they had worked together for a decade.\n\nReactions in Iran\n\n\nCrew of Soyuz TMA&#8211;9: Astronaut Michael E. Lopez&#8211;Alegria (left), Anousheh Ansari (middle) and cosmonaut Mikhail Tyurin at the Cosmonaut Hotel in Baikonur, Kazakhstan on Sept. 5, 2006\nReactions to the flight in Ansari\'s native Iran were generally mixed. It was given significant coverage by state television. IRIB aired a live 1 hour interview with Anousheh in Aseman&#8211;e&#8211;Shab (Night Sky) live show. Anousheh was praised by newspapers such as Hambastegi and Jam&#8211;e&#8211;Jam Daily, which published daily columns detailing the journey. The astronomy magazine NOJUM also published an exclusive interview of Pouria Nazemi with Anousheh before her trip, in which she discussed her vision for commercial spaceflight. NOJUM also organized and held gatherings when the ISS passed over Iran\'s cities. Shahram Yazdanpanah, made a special part about Anousheh\'s trip to space at Persian \"Space Science\" website and covered all the news of trip.[39]\n\nInterviews\nOn September 22, 2006, she told reporters that she has no regrets and said \"I am having a wonderful time here. It\'s been more than what I expected, and I am enjoying every single second of it. The entire experience has been wonderful up here.\"[40]\n\nHonors and awards\nAnsari has received multiple honors, including the George Mason University Entrepreneurial Excellence Award, the George Washington University Distinguished Alumni Achievement Award, the Ernst and Young Entrepreneur of the Year Award for the Southwest Region, and the Horatio Alger Award. While under her leadership, Telecom Technologies, Inc. earned recognition as one of Inc. magazine\'s 500 fastest&#8211;growing companies and one of Deloitte and Touche’s Fast 500 technology companies. She was listed in Fortune Magazine\'s \"40 under 40\" list in 2001 and honored by Working Woman magazine as the winner of the 2000 National Entrepreneurial Excellence award.[citation needed]\n\nIn 2009 she was received the first Symons Innovator Award given annually by NCWIT to honor successful women entrepreneurs in technology.[full citation needed]\n\nShe received an Honorary Doctorate of Science from George Mason University on December 20, 2012.\n\nThe Ansari family was recently[when?] honored with an Orbit Award by the National Space Society and Space Tourism Society for underwriting the Ansari X PRIZE.[citation needed]\n\nAnousheh Ansari participated as a speaker at the 2010 Honeywell Leadership Academy at Space Camp in Huntsville Alabama with Homer Hickam.[41]\n\nIn 2010, she was awarded the Ellis Island Medal of Honor in recognition of her humanitarian efforts.[42]\n\nIn 2009, Ansari was featured in the documentary film Space Tourists by independent Swiss filmmaker Christian Frei about billionaires who paid to ride to the International Space Station aboard Russian spacecraft.[43] The DVD of the film was released in 2011.\n\nShe served as the commencement speaker at and received an Honorary Doctorate of Science from Utah Valley University on April 25, 2013.[44]\n\nSee also\nIranian women\nList of famous Persian women\nList of International Space Station visitors\nReferences\n^ \"Payvan News\".

<string name="Sunita_Williams">Sunita Lyn \"Suni\" Williams née Pandya [1] (born September 19, 1965) is a former American astronaut and a United States Navy officer. She holds the records for longest single space flight by a woman (195 days),[2] total spacewalks by a woman (seven), and most spacewalk time for a woman (50 hours, 40 minutes).[3][4]\n\nWilliams was assigned to the International Space Station as a member of Expedition 14 and Expedition 15. In 2012, she served as a flight engineer on Expedition 32 and then commander of Expedition 33.\n\nContents  [hide] \n1 Ancestry and early life\n2 Military career\n3 NASA career\n4 Spaceflight experience\n4.1 STS&#8211;116\n4.2 Expeditions 14 and 15\n4.3 Expeditions 32 and 33\n5 Spacewalks\n6 2007 visit to India\n7 Personal life\n8 Organizations\n9 Honors and awards\n10 See also\n11 References\n12 External links\nAncestry and early life\nSunita Williams was born in Euclid, Ohio, to Indian American neuroanatomist Deepak Pandya and Slovene American Ursuline Bonnie Pandya (née Zalokar), who have three children and reside in Falmouth, Massachusetts. Sunita is the youngest of three siblings, her brother Jay Thomas is four years older and her sister Dina Anna is three years older.\n\nWilliams’ paternal ancestry is from Jhulasan, Mehsana district in Gujarat, India, while her maternal great grandmother Mary Bohinc (originally Marija Bohinjec), born 5 September 1890 in Leše, immigrated to America as an eleven year old girl with her mother, an 1891 Slovene emigrant Ursula Bohinc née Strajhar.[5][6]\n\nWilliams graduated from Needham High School in Needham, Massachusetts, in 1983. She received a Bachelor of Science degree in Physical science from the United States Naval Academy in 1987, and a Master of Science degree in Engineering Management from Florida Institute of Technology in 1995.[2]\n\nMilitary career\nWilliams was commissioned an ensign in the United States Navy in May 1987. After a six&#8211;month temporary assignment at the Naval Coastal System Command, she was designated a Basic Diving Officer. She next reported to the Naval Air Training Command, where she was designated a Naval Aviator in July 1989. She received initial H&#8211;46 Sea Knight training in Helicopter Combat Support Squadron 3 (HC&#8211;3), and was then assigned to Helicopter Combat Support Squadron 8 (HC&#8211;8) in Norfolk, Virginia, with which she made overseas deployments to the Mediterranean, Red Sea and the Persian Gulf for Operation Desert Shield and Operation Provide Comfort. In September 1992, she was the Officer&#8211;in&#8211;Charge of an H&#8211;46 detachment sent to Miami, Florida, for Hurricane Andrew relief operations aboard the USS Sylvania. In January 1993, Williams began training at the U.S. Naval Test Pilot School. She graduated in December, and was assigned to the Rotary Wing Aircraft Test Directorate as an H&#8211;46 Project Officer and V&#8211;22 chase pilot in the T&#8211;2. Later, she was assigned as the squadron Safety Officer and flew test flights in the SH&#8211;60B/F, UH&#8211;1, AH&#8211;1W, SH&#8211;2, VH&#8211;3, H&#8211;46, CH&#8211;53, and the H&#8211;57. In December 1995, she went back to the Naval Test Pilot School as an instructor in the Rotary Wing Department and as the school\'s Safety Officer. There she flew the UH&#8211;60, OH&#8211;6, and the OH&#8211;58. She then went to the USS Saipan as the Aircraft Handler and the Assistant Air Boss. Williams was deployed on the Saipan in June 1998 when she was selected by NASA for the astronaut program.[2]\n\nShe has logged more than 3,000 flight hours in more than 30 aircraft types.[2]\n\nNASA career\n\n\nAstronaut Sunita L. Williams, Expedition 14 flight engineer, participates in the mission\'s third planned session of extravehicular activity (EVA).\nWilliams began her Astronaut Candidate training at the Johnson Space Center in August 1998.[2] It included\n\nSpaceflight experience\nSTS&#8211;116\nWilliams was launched to the International Space Station (ISS) with STS&#8211;116, aboard the Space Shuttle Discovery, on December 9, 2006, to join the Expedition 14 crew. In April 2007, the Russian members of the crew rotated, changing to Expedition 15.\n\nAmong the personal items Williams took with her to the ISS were a copy of the Bhagavad Gita, a small figurine of the Hindu deity Ganesha, and some samosas.[7]\n\nExpeditions 14 and 15\n\n\nWilliams became the first person to run the Boston Marathon from the space station on April 16, 2007.\nAfter launching aboard the Shuttle Discovery, Williams arranged to donate her pony tail to Locks of Love. Fellow astronaut Joan Higginbotham cut her hair aboard the International Space Station and the ponytail was brought back to Earth by the STS&#8211;116 crew.[8]\n\nWilliams performed her first extra&#8211;vehicular activity on the eighth day of the STS&#8211;116 mission. On January 31, February 4, and February 9, 2007, she completed three spacewalks from the ISS with Michael López&#8211;Alegría. During one of these walks, a camera became untethered, probably because the attaching device failed, and floated off to space before Williams could react.[9]\n\n\n\nSunita L. Williams and Joan E. Higginbotham (foreground) (STS&#8211;116 mission specialist) refer to a procedures checklist as they work the controls of the Canadarm2 in the International Space Station\'s Destiny laboratory.\nOn the third spacewalk, Williams was outside the station for 6 hours and 40 minutes to complete three spacewalks in nine days. She has logged 29 hours and 17 minutes in four spacewalks, eclipsing the record held by Kathryn C. Thornton for most spacewalk time by a woman.[2][4] On December 18, 2007, during the fourth spacewalk of Expedition 16, Peggy Whitson surpassed Williams, with a cumulative EVA time of 32 hours, 36 minutes.[10][11]\n\nIn early March 2007, she received a tube of wasabi in a Progress spacecraft resupply mission in response to her request for more spicy food. When she opened the tube, which was packaged at one atmospheric pressure, the gel&#8211;like paste was forced out in the lower pressure of the ISS. In the free&#8211;fall environment, the spicy geyser was difficult to contain.[12]\n\nOn April 16, 2007, she ran the first marathon by a person in orbit.[13] Williams finished the 2007 Boston Marathon in four hours and 24 minutes .[14][15][16] The other crew members cheered her on and gave her oranges during the race. Williams\' sister, Dina Pandya, and fellow astronaut Karen L. Nyberg ran the marathon on Earth, and Williams received updates on their progress from Mission Control. In 2008, Williams participated in the Boston Marathon again, this time on Earth. That same year, on the game show Duel, a question was made from that event. The answers were: London, New York, International Space Station, Paris. The most correct was the ISS.\n\nOn April 26, 2007, NASA decided to bring Williams back to Earth on the STS&#8211;117 mission aboard Atlantis. She did not break the U.S. single spaceflight record that was recently broken by former crewmember Commander Michael López&#8211;Alegría, but did break the record for longest single spaceflight by a woman.[2][17][18]\n\nWilliams served as a mission specialist and returned to Earth on June 22, 2007, at the end of the STS&#8211;117 mission. Poor weather at the Kennedy Space Center in Cape Canaveral forced mission managers to skip three landing attempts there over previous 24 hours. They then diverted Atlantis to Edwards Air Force Base in California, where the shuttle touched down at 3:49 p.m. EDT, returning Williams home after a record 192&#8211;day stay in space.\n\nExpeditions 32 and 33\n\n\nWilliams exercises on COLBERT during ISS Expedition 32.\nWilliams launched from the Baikonur Cosmodrome on July 15, 2012 as part of Expedition 32/33. Her Russian spacecraft Soyuz TMA&#8211;05M docked with the ISS for a four&#8211;month stay at the orbiting outpost on 17 July 2012.[19] The docking of the Soyuz occurred at 4:51 GMT as the ISS flew over Kazakhstan at an altitude of 252 miles. The hatchway between the Soyuz spacecraft and the ISS was opened at 7:23 GMT and Williams floated into the ISS to begin her duties as a member of the Expedition 32 crew. She was accompanied on the Soyuz TMA&#8211;05M spacecraft by Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) astronaut Aki Hoshide and Russian cosmonaut Yuri Malenchenko. Williams served as commander of the ISS during her stay onboard ISS Expedition 33, succeeding Gennady Padalka.[20] She became the commander of the International Space Station on September 17, 2012, being only the second woman to achieve the feat.[21] Also in September 2012, she became the first person to do a triathlon in space, which coincided with the Nautica Malibu Triathlon held in Southern California on Earth.[22] She used the International Space Station\'s own treadmill and stationary bike, and for the swimming portion of the race, she used the Advanced Resistive Exercise Device (ARED) to do weightlifting and resistance exercises that approximate swimming in microgravity. After \"swimming\" half a mile (0.8 km), biking 18 miles (29 km), and running 4 miles (6.4 km), Williams finished with a time of one hour, 48 minutes and 33 seconds, as she reported.[22]\n\nShe returned to earth with fellow astronauts Flight Engineers Yuri Malenchenko and Aki Hoshide on 19 November 2012, touching down in the town of Arkalyk, Kazakhstan. Helicopters joined the search&#8211;and&#8211;recovery crew to assist them, as their capsule parachuted down some 35 kilometres (22 mi) from the planned touchdown site due to a procedural delay.[23]\n\nSpacewalks\n\n\nSunita Williams, Expedition 32 flight engineer, appears to touch the bright sun during a spacewalk conducted on 5 September 2012.\nAs of November 2012, Williams has made seven spacewalks totaling 50 hours and 40 minutes,[24] putting Williams in No. 5 on the list of most experienced spacewalkers.[25]\n\nOn August 30, 2012, Williams and JAXA astronaut Hoshide ventured outside the ISS to conduct US EVA&#8211;18. They removed and replaced the failing Main Bus Switching Unit&#8211;1 (MBSU&#8211;1), and installed a thermal cover onto Pressurized Mating Adapter&#8211;2 (PMA&#8211;2).[26]\n\n2007 visit to India\nIn September 2007, Williams visited India. She went to the Sabarmati Ashram, the ashram set up by Mahatma Gandhi in 1915, and her ancestral village Jhulasan in Gujarat. She was awarded the Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel Vishwa Pratibha Award by the World Gujarati Society,[27] the first person of Indian descent who was not an Indian citizen to be presented the award. On October 4, 2007, Williams spoke at the American Embassy School, and then met Manmohan Singh, the Prime Minister of India.[28]\n\n\nWilliams at the Nehru Memorial in Delhi\n \n\nWilliams with Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh\n \n\nApril 2013 in Science City Kolkata\nPersonal life\nWilliams is married to Michael J. Williams, a Federal police officer in Oregon. The two have been married for more than 20 years, and both flew helicopters in the early days of their careers. She has a pet Jack Russell Terrier named Gorby who was featured with her on the \"Dog Whisperer\" television show on the National Geographic Channel on November 12, 2010.[29] Her recreational interests include running, swimming, biking, triathlons, windsurfing, snowboarding and bow hunting. She is an avid Boston Red Sox fan.\n\nWilliams has expressed a desire to adopt a girl from Ahmedabad.[30]\n\nOrganizations\nSociety of Experimental Test Pilots\nSociety of Flight Test Engineers\nAmerican Helicopter Association\nHonors and awards\nThis article incorporates information from the equivalent article on the Polish Wikipedia.\nNavy Commendation Medal, twice\nNavy and Marine Corps Achievement Medal\nHumanitarian Service Medal\nMedal \"For Merit in Space Exploration\" (Russia, 2011) &#8211; for outstanding contribution to the development of international cooperation in manned space flight\nPadma Bhushan[31]\nHonorary Doctorate by Gujarat Technological University in 2013 [32]\nGolden Order for Merits (Slovenia, 2013) &#8211; for her contribution to the promotion of natural and technical sciences, and especially their promotion among younger generations of Slovenes [33]\n	Wikimedia Commons has media related to Sunita Williams.\nSee also\nList of Asian American astronauts\nList of female astronauts\nReferences\n This article incorporates public domain material from websites or documents of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration.\n\n^ \"Astronaut Biography: Sunita Williams\".

<string name="Joan_Higginbotham">Joan Elizabeth Higginbotham (born August 3, 1964) is an American engineer and a former NASA astronaut. She flew aboard Space Shuttle Discovery mission STS&#8211;116 as a mission specialist.[2]\n\nContents  [hide] \n1 Early life and education\n2 Career\n2.1 NASA\n3 Awards and Honors\n4 See also\n5 References\nEarly life and education\nHigginbotham was born in Chicago, Illinois, and attended Whitney Young Magnet High School, graduating in 1982.[2] She received a Bachelor of Science degree from the Southern Illinois University Carbondale in 1987, and a Masters of Management Science (1992) and Masters in Space Systems (1996) both from the Florida Institute of Technology. She is the third African American woman to go into space, after Mae Jemison and Stephanie Wilson.[2]\n\nHigginbotham is a member of Delta Sigma Theta Sorority and The Links, Incorporated.[2]\n\nCareer\nNASA\n\n\nJoan E. Higginbotham (foreground) and Sunita L. Williams (Expedition 14 flight engineer) refer to a procedures checklist as they work the controls of the Canadarm2 in the International Space Station\'s Destiny laboratory during flight day four of STS&#8211;116.\nHigginbotham began her career in 1987 at the Kennedy Space Center (KSC), Florida, as a Payload Electrical Engineer in the Electrical and Telecommunications Systems Division.[2][3] Within six months she became the lead for the Orbiter Experiments (OEX) on OV&#8211;102, the Space Shuttle Columbia. She later worked on the Shuttle payload bay reconfiguration for all Shuttle missions and conducted electrical compatibility tests for all payloads flown aboard the Shuttle. She was also tasked by KSC management to undertake several special assignments where she served as the Executive Staff Assistant to the Director of Shuttle Operations and Management, led a team of engineers in performing critical analysis for the Space Shuttle flow in support of a simulation model tool, and worked on an interactive display detailing the Space Shuttle processing procedures at Spaceport USA (Kennedy Space Center’s Visitors Center). Higginbotham then served as backup orbiter project engineer for OV&#8211;104, Space Shuttle Atlantis, where she participated in the integration of the orbiter docking station (ODS) into the space shuttle used during Shuttle/Mir docking missions. Two years later, she was promoted to lead orbiter project engineer for OV&#8211;102, Space Shuttle Columbia. In this position, she held the technical lead government engineering position in the firing room where she supported and managed the integration of vehicle testing and troubleshooting. She actively participated in 53 space shuttle launches during her 9&#8211;year tenure at Kennedy Space Center.\n\nSelected as an astronaut candidate by NASA in April 1996, Higginbotham reported to the Johnson Space Center in August 1996. Since that time, she had been assigned technical duties in the Payloads and Habitability Branch, the Shuttle Avionics and Integration Laboratory (SAIL), the Kennedy Space Center (KSC) Operations (Ops) Support Branch, where she tested various modules of the International Space Station for operability, compatibility, and functionality prior to launch, the Astronaut Office CAPCOM (Capsule Communicator) Branch in the startup and support of numerous space station missions and space shuttle missions, the Robotics Branch, and Lead for the International Space Station Systems Crew Interfaces Section.\n\nHigginbotham logged over 308 hours in space during her mission with the crew of STS&#8211;116 where her primary task was to operate the Space Station Remote Manipulator System (SSRMS). Higginbotham took a scarf for the Houston Dynamo on board with her during her mission.[4]\n\nHigginbotham was originally assigned to the crew of STS&#8211;126 targeted for launch in September 2008.[5][6] On November 21, 2007, NASA announced a change in the crew manifest, due to Higginbotham\'s decision to leave NASA to take a job in the private sector.[7] Donald Pettit replaced Higginbotham for STS&#8211;126.[8]\n\nAwards and Honors\nIn 2007, Higginbotham received the Adler Planetarium Women in Space Science Award.\n\nNASA Exceptional Service Medal\nGroup Award for achievements related to the flight of STS&#8211;26 (the first shuttle flight after the Challenger disaster)\nCommendation of Merit for Service to the Department of Defense Missions\nBlack Rose Award (2007) awarded by the (League of Black Women) for contribution to gender equality\nSee also\nList of African&#8211;American astronauts\nReferences\n^ \"NASA STS&#8211;116\".

<string name="Tracy_Caldwell_Dyson">Tracy Caldwell Dyson (born Tracy Ellen Caldwell, August 14, 1969) is an American chemist and NASA astronaut. Caldwell Dyson was a Mission Specialist on Space Shuttle Endeavour flight STS&#8211;118 in August 2007. She was part of the Expedition 24 crew on the International Space Station between April 4, 2010 and September 25, 2010. She has completed three spacewalks, logging more than 22 hrs of EVA including work to replace a malfunctioning coolant pump.[1][2]\n\nContents  [hide] \n1 Academic career\n2 NASA career\n3 Personal life\n4 Education\n5 Organizations\n6 Awards and honors\n7 See also\n8 References\n9 External links\nAcademic career\nAs an undergraduate researcher at the California State University, Fullerton (CSUF), Caldwell Dyson designed, constructed and implemented electronics and hardware associated with a laser&#8211;ionization, time&#8211;of&#8211;flight mass spectrometer for studying atmospherically relevant gas&#8211;phase chemistry.[1]\n\nAlso at CSUF, she worked for the Research and Instructional Safety Office as a lab assistant performing environmental monitoring of laboratories using hazardous chemicals and radioactive materials, as well as calibrating survey instruments and helping to process chemical and radioactive waste. During that time (and for many years prior) she also worked as an electrician/inside wireman for her father’s electrical contracting company doing commercial and light industrial type construction.[1]\n\nAt the University of California, Davis, Caldwell Dyson taught general chemistry laboratory and began her graduate research. Her dissertation work focused on investigating molecular&#8211;level surface reactivity and kinetics of metal surfaces using electron spectroscopy, laser desorption, and Fourier transform mass spectrometry techniques. She also designed and built peripheral components for a variable temperature, ultra&#8211;high vacuum scanning tunneling microscopy system.[1]\n\nIn 1997, Caldwell Dyson received the Camille and Henry Drefus Postdoctoral Fellowship in Environmental Science to study atmospheric chemistry at the University of California, Irvine. There she investigated reactivity and kinetics of atmospherically relevant systems using atmospheric pressure ionization mass spectrometry, Fourier transform infrared and ultraviolet absorption spectroscopies. In addition, she developed methods of chemical ionization for spectral interpretation of trace compounds. Caldwell Dyson has published and presented her work in numerous papers at technical conferences and in scientific journals.[1]\n\n\n\nCaldwell Dyson during celebrations for the 40th anniversary of the first moon landing, 2009\nNASA career\nSelected by NASA in June 1998, Caldwell Dyson reported for training in August 1998. Her Astronaut Candidate Training included orientation briefings and tours, numerous scientific and technical briefings, intensive instruction in Shuttle and International Space Station (ISS) systems, physiological training, ground school to prepare for T&#8211;38 flight training, as well as learning water and wilderness survival techniques. Completion of this training and evaluation qualified her for flight assignment as a mission specialist.\n\nIn 1999, Caldwell Dyson was assigned to the Astronaut Office ISS Operations Branch as a Russian Crusader, participating in the testing and integration of Russian hardware and software products developed for ISS. In 2000, she was assigned prime Crew Support Astronaut for the ISS Expedition 5 crew, serving as their representative on technical and operational issues throughout the training and on&#8211;orbit phase of their mission.\n\nDuring ISS Expeditions 4 through 6, Caldwell Dyson also served as an ISS spacecraft communicator (CAPCOM) inside Mission Control. In 2003, she made a transition to the Astronaut Shuttle Operations Branch and was assigned to flight software verification in the Shuttle Avionics Integration Laboratory (SAIL) and also worked supporting launch and landing operations at Kennedy Space Center, Florida. Caldwell Dyson also served as Lead CAPCOM for Expedition 11.\n\nCaldwell Dyson was assigned to, and later flew on STS&#8211;118, Space Shuttle Endeavour, on August 8&#8211;21, 2007, which was the 119th space shuttle flight, the 22nd flight to the station, and the 20th flight for Endeavour. Caldwell Dyson was assigned as Mission Specialist #1 on this flight. During the mission Endeavour\'s crew successfully added another truss segment, a new gyroscope and external spare parts platform to the International Space Station. A new system that enables docked shuttles to draw electrical power from the station to extend visits to the outpost was activated successfully. A total of four spacewalks (EVAs) were performed by three crew members. Endeavour carried some 5,000 pounds of equipment and supplies to the station and returned to Earth with some 4,000 pounds of hardware and no longer needed equipment. Traveling 5.3 million miles in space, the STS&#8211;118 mission was completed in 12 days, 17 hours, 55 minutes and 34 seconds. Finally, during the flight of STS&#8211;118, Caldwell Dyson celebrated her 38th birthday in space.\n\nOn April 4, 2010, Caldwell Dyson joined the Expedition 23 crew aboard ISS. She lifted off on April 2, 2010 from the Baikonur spaceport aboard a Russian Soyuz capsule (Soyuz TMA&#8211;18). After 176 days duty as part of the Expedition 24 crew, she returned to Earth with the Soyuz TMA&#8211;18 landing unit. Together with commander Aleksandr Skvortsov and flight engineer Mikhail Korniyenko, Dyson landed in Kazakhstan on September 25, 2010.[3]\n\nIn a television interview on the 40th anniversary of the first moon landing, she said she is the first astronaut who was born after Apollo 11.[4]\n\nPersonal life\nCaldwell Dyson, the younger of two girls, was born in Arcadia, California,[1] and later moved to Beaumont, California, in the early 1980s to attend junior high school where her father worked as an electrician. Her recreational interests include running, weight training, hiking, softball, basketball, and auto repair/maintenance. As an undergraduate, she competed in intercollegiate athletics on the CSUF Titans track team as both a sprinter and long jumper.[1]\n\nCaldwell Dyson is a private pilot and conversational in American Sign Language (ASL) and Russian.[citation needed]\n\nShe is married to Naval Aviator George Dyson.[2] She is also the lead vocalist for the all&#8211;astronaut band Max Q.[5]\n\nEducation\nBeaumont High School, Beaumont, California, 1987 [2]\nB.S., Chemistry, California State University, Fullerton (CSUF), 1993 [1]\nPh.D., Physical Chemistry, University of California, Davis, 1997 [1]\nOrganizations\nCaldwell Dyson belongs to the Sigma Xi Research Society and the American Chemical Society.\n\nAwards and honors\n\n\nCaldwell Dyson in the Cupola module of the International Space Station observing Earth.\nHonorary Doctorate, California State University, Fullerton (CSUF) (May 2008)\nNASA Performance Award (2002 and 2001)\nNASA Go the Extra Mile (GEM) Award (2001)\nNASA Superior Accomplishment Award (2000)\nNASA Group Achievement Award &#8211; Russian Crusader Team (2000)\nCamille and Henry Dreyfus Postdoctoral Fellowship in Environmental Science (1997)\nOutstanding Doctoral Student Award in Chemistry from the University of California, Davis (1997)\nAmerican Vacuum Society &#8211; HWhetten Award (1996)\nAmerican Vacuum Society Graduate Research Award (1996)\nPro Femina Research Consortium Graduate Research Award (1996)\nPro Femina Research Consortium Graduate Award for Scientific Travel (1996)\nUniversity of California, Davis Graduate Research Award (1996)\nUniversity of California, Davis Graduate Student Award for Scientific Travel (1994)\nPatricia Roberts Harris Graduate Fellowship in Chemistry (1993&#8211;1997)\nLyle Wallace Award for Service to the Department of Chemistry, California State University Fullerton (1993)\nNational Science Foundation Research Experience for Undergraduates Award (1992)\nCouncil of Building and Construction Trades Scholarship (1991 and 1992)\nBig West Scholar Athlete (1989&#8211;1991)\nSee also\n Biography portal\n Spaceflight portal\nReferences\n This article incorporates public domain material from websites or documents of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration.\n\n^ to: a b c d e f g h i \"Tracy Caldwell Dyson Biographical Data\".

<string name="Barbara_Morgan">Barbara Radding Morgan (born November 28, 1951) is an American teacher and a former NASA astronaut. She participated in the Teacher in Space program as the backup to Christa McAuliffe for the ill&#8211;fated STS&#8211;51&#8211;L mission of the Space Shuttle Challenger. She then trained as a Mission Specialist, and flew on STS&#8211;118 in August 2007. Leading up to STS&#8211;118, Morgan joined Sally Ride and Shannon Lucid as female astronauts widely covered by the media.\n\nContents  [hide] \n1 Early life and education\n2 Teaching career\n3 Teacher in Space Project\n4 NASA career\n4.1 Spaceflight experience\n5 Post&#8211;NASA career\n6 Awards and honors\n7 Personal life\n8 References\n9 External links\nEarly life and education\nMorgan was born to Dr. and Mrs. Jerry Radding in 1951 and raised in Fresno, California, where she attended Herbert Hoover High School. Following graduation in 1969, she was accepted to Stanford University in Palo Alto, California, where she graduated with distinction in 1973 with a B.A. in Human Biology. She obtained her teaching credential from Notre Dame de Namur University in nearby Belmont in 1974.[1]\n\nTeaching career\nMorgan began her teaching career in 1974 on the Flathead Indian Reservation at Arlee Elementary School in Arlee, Montana, where she taught remedial reading and math. From 1975 to 1978, she taught remedial reading/math and second grade at McCall&#8211;Donnelly Elementary School in McCall, Idaho. From 1978 to 1979, Morgan taught English and science to third graders at Colegio Americano de Quito in Quito, Ecuador for a year. From 1979 to 1998, Morgan taught second, third, and fourth grades at McCall&#8211;Donnelly Elementary School.\n\nTeacher in Space Project\n\n\nMorgan (right) and Christa McAuliffe in 1985.\nMorgan was selected as the backup candidate for the NASA Teacher in Space Project on July 19, 1985. From September 1985 to January 1986, Morgan trained with Christa McAuliffe and the Space Shuttle Challenger crew at NASA\'s Johnson Space Center, Houston, Texas. Following McAuliffe\'s death in the Challenger disaster, Morgan assumed the duties of Teacher in Space Designee. From March 1986 to July 1986, she worked with NASA, speaking to educational organizations throughout the country. In the fall of 1986, Morgan returned to Idaho to resume her teaching career. She taught second and third grades at McCall&#8211;Donnelly Elementary and continued to work with NASA\'s Education Division, Office of Human Resources and Education. Her duties as Teacher in Space Designee included public speaking, educational consulting, curriculum design, and serving on the National Science Foundation\'s Federal Task Force for Women and Minorities in Science and Engineering.[2]\n\nNASA career\nIn January 1998, 12 years after McAuliffe\'s death, Morgan was selected by NASA as a Mission Specialist and reported to the Johnson Space Center in August 1998, making her a full&#8211;time astronaut. Following the completion of two years of training and evaluation, she was assigned technical duties in the Astronaut Office Space Station Operations Branch. She served in the Astronaut Office CAPCOM Branch, working in Mission Control as prime communicator with on&#8211;orbit crews.[3]\n\nLike many other astronauts and cosmonauts, Morgan is a licensed amateur radio operator, having passed the technician class license exam in 2003. On March 2, 2003, she was issued an amateur radio license by the FCC. This qualifies her to use the facilities of the Amateur Radio on the International Space Station (ARISS) project.[4][5]\n\nMorgan\'s duties as a Mission Specialist were no different than those of other crew members. While NASA press releases and media briefings often refer to her as a \"Mission Specialist Educator\" or \"Educator Astronaut\", Morgan did not train in the Educator Astronaut Project. NASA Administrator Michael D. Griffin clarified at a press conference after STS&#8211;118 that Morgan was not considered a Mission Specialist Educator, but rather was a standard Mission Specialist, who had been a teacher.[6]\n\nPrior to her flight on STS&#8211;118, NASA seemed to limit Morgan\'s exposure to the press, but Morgan did a series of interviews shortly before the start of the mission about what the crew of STS&#8211;118 would be doing to help build the International Space Station,[7][8][9][10] commenting, \"You know, there\'s a great sense of pride to be able to be involved in a human endeavor that takes us all a little bit farther. When you look down and see our Earth, and you realize what we are trying to do as a human race, it\'s pretty profound.[11]\n\nThree weeks after Morgan\'s mission ended, she conducted her first space education assignment at Walt Disney World in Florida, telling those in attendance to \"Reach for your dreams ... the sky is no limit.\" Morgan\'s words were etched into a plaque on a wall of Mission: Space. The \"Wall of Honor\" contains quotes from notable people, such as Neil Armstrong, John F. Kennedy, Charles Lindbergh, Stephen Hawking, Carl Sagan, Galileo, and Christa McAuliffe. Morgan\'s plaque is placed beside McAuliffe\'s, which says: \"Space is for everybody ... That\'s our new frontier out there.\"[12] This event was one of a series of lectures Morgan would complete.\n\nSpaceflight experience\nSTS&#8211;118, an assembly mission to the International Space Station, successfully launched from Florida\'s Kennedy Space Center at 6:36:42 p.m. EDT, 8 August 2007.[13] Morgan served as robotic arm operator, and transfer coordinator, coordinating the transfer of over 5,000 pounds (2,300 kg) of cargo to the International Space Station, and bringing home over 3,000 pounds (1,400 kg).[14] In addition to her other duties, Morgan participated in twenty minute amateur radio question and answer sessions with young people at the Discovery Center of Idaho and other centers, and joined Mission Specialist Alvin Drew in an education event with young people at the Challenger Center for Space Science Education in Alexandria, Virginia.[15][16] The event was hosted by Dr. June Scobee, widow of Space Shuttle Challenger\'s commander, Richard \"Dick\" Scobee. The center honored Morgan with the President George H.W. Bush Leadership Award. STS&#8211;118 landed successfully at Kennedy Space Center on August 21, a day ahead of schedule due to concerns about Hurricane Dean.[17][18][19]\n\nPost&#8211;NASA career\nOn June 28, 2008, Morgan announced that she would leave NASA for a teaching job at Boise State University. In August 2008, Morgan took a full&#8211;time position as a Distinguished Educator in Residence; a dual appointment to BSU\'s colleges of engineering and education. There she advises, leads and represents the university in policy development, advocacy and fund&#8211;raising in science, technology, engineering and math.[20]\n\nOn 4 July 2008, Morgan received the \"Friend of Education\" award from the National Education Association. The following month Barbara R. Morgan Elementary School opened in McCall.[21]\n\nAwards and honors\nMorgan received the Adler Planetarium Women in Space Science Award in 2008.[citation needed]\n\nPersonal life\nMorgan is married to writer Clay Morgan of McCall, Idaho;[22] they have two sons. She is a classical flautist who also enjoys jazz, literature, hiking, swimming, and cross&#8211;country skiing.[1][23][24]\n\nReferences\n^ to: a b NASA (2007). \"Barbara Radding Morgan &#8211; NASA Astronaut biography\".

<string name="Yi_So_yeon">Yi So&#8211;yeon (born June 2, 1978) is a scientist who became the first Korean to fly in space.[1]\n\nContents  [hide] \n1 Biography\n2 Korean Astronaut Program\n2.1 Terminology\n3 Mission\n4 Return flight\n5 Post&#8211;flight\n6 See also\n7 References\n8 External links\nBiography\nYi So&#8211;yeon was born to father Yi Gil&#8211;soo and mother Jeong Geum&#8211;soon and raised in Gwangju, South Korea.[2]\n\nYi studied at Gwangju Science High School. She earned bachelor’s and master’s degrees with a focus on mechanics at KAIST in Daejeon. Her doctorate in biotech systems was conferred on 29 February 2008 in a ceremony at KAIST although she was unable to be present due to her training commitments in Russia.\n\nKorean Astronaut Program\nMain article: Korean Astronaut Program\n\n\nYi So&#8211;yeon and Ko San participate in a space station hardware training session in the Space Vehicle Mockup Facility at the Johnson Space Center by Crew Systems instructor Glenn Johnson.\nYi was one of the two finalists chosen on 25 December 2006 through the Korean Astronaut Program. On 5 September 2007, the Korean Ministry of Science and Technology chose Ko San, over Yi So&#8211;yeon, following performance and other tests during their training in Russia.[3][4]\n\nOn 7 March 2008, she was selected to train with the primary crew, and on 10 March the Ministry of Education, Science and Technology announced that Yi would replace Ko. This was after the Russian Federal Space Agency asked for a replacement because Ko violated regulations several times at a Russian training center by removing sensitive reading materials and mailing one back to Korea.[5][6][7][8] On 8 April 2008, Yi was launched into space on board Soyuz TMA&#8211;12, with two Russian cosmonauts. South Korea is reported to have paid Russia $20 Million for Yi\'s space flight.[9] She makes South Korea the third country, after the United Kingdom and Iran, to have a woman as its first space traveler.\n\nTerminology\nFlying as a guest of the Russian government through a commercial agreement with South Korea, Yi\'s role aboard Soyuz and the ISS is referred to as a spaceflight participant (Russian: uchastnik kosmicheskovo poleta) in Russian Federal Space Agency and NASA documents and press briefings.[10]\n\nMission\nDuring her mission, Yi So&#8211;yeon carried out 18 science experiments for KARI and conducted interviews and discussions with media. In particular, she took with her 1,000 fruit flies in a special air&#8211;conditioned container box (Konkuk University experiment). She monitored the way the changes in gravity and other environmental conditions alter the behaviour of the flies, or their genome. Other experiments involved the growth of plants in space, the study of the behaviour of her heart, and the effects of gravity change on the pressure in her eye and shape of her face. With a specially designed three&#8211;dimensional Samsung camera, Yi took six shots of her face every day to see how it swells in the different gravity. She also observed the Earth, and in particular the movement of dust storms from China to Korea.[11] She also measured the noise levels on board the ISS.[12]\n\n\n\nYi So&#8211;yeon with NASA astronaut Peggy Whitson (right), Expedition 16 commander, and Russian Federal Space Agency cosmonaut Yuri Malenchenko (middle), flight engineer, at the International Space Station.\nSouth Korean scientists created a special low&#8211;calorie and vitamin&#8211;rich version of kimchi for Yi.[13]\n\nReturn flight\nAt the end of the mission, Yi returned to Earth along with ISS crew members Peggy Whitson and Yuri Malenchenko aboard Soyuz TMA&#8211;11, on April 19, 2008. Due to a malfunction with the Soyuz vehicle, the craft followed a ballistic re&#8211;entry which subjects the crew to severe gravitational forces up to 10 times the amount experienced on Earth. As a result of the re&#8211;entry, the TMA&#8211;11 craft used in the return flight landed 260 miles (420 km) off&#8211;course from its target in Kazakhstan.[14][15] All three survived, although requiring observation by medical personnel.[16]\n\nYi was hospitalized after her return to Korea due to severe back pains. Though many believed these pains were the result of the rough landing, they were in fact normal and expected. They were the result of spinal re&#8211;compression.[17]\n\nPost&#8211;flight\nAfter her flight, Yi works as a researcher at KARI as well as acting as Korea\'s space ambassador, together with Ko San. She will also receive income from future TV commercials.[18] On 4 October 2008, Yi launched the International Institute of Space Commerce, at a ceremony held in Douglas, Isle of Man.[19] Based on Yi\'s track record so early on in her career, she has been listed as one of the 15 Asian Scientists To Watch by Asian Scientist Magazine on 15 May 2011.[20]\n\nSee also\nKorean Astronaut Program\nKorea Aerospace Research Institute\nTimeline of space travel by nationality\nARISS (Amateur Radio on the International Space Station)\nReferences\n^ 바이코누르 (2008&#8211;04&#8211;08). \"한국 최초 우주인 이소연과 그 동료들\" (in Korean).

In addition, they performed 16 engineering tests aboard the Orbiter Columbia and 20 Extended Duration Orbiter Medical Project experiments. The mission was accomplished in 225 orbits of the Earth, traveling 5.8 million miles in 336 hours, 13 minutes and 1 second. Landing was at Edwards Air Force Base, California. In completing this flight, Lucid logged 838 hours and 54 minutes in space.\n\nLucid holds the United States single&#8211;mission spaceflight endurance record on the Russian Space Station Mir. Following a year of training in Star City, Russia, her journey started with liftoff at KSC on March 22, 1996, aboard STS&#8211;76 Atlantis. Following docking, she transferred to the Mir Space Station. Assigned as a board engineer 2, she performed numerous life science and physical science experiments during the course of her stay aboard Mir. Her return journey to KSC was made aboard STS&#8211;79 Atlantis on September 26, 1996. In completing this mission, Lucid traveled 75.2 million miles in 188 days, 4 hours, 0 minutes and 14 seconds.\n\nAwards and honors\nLucid was awarded the Congressional Space Medal of Honor in December 1996, the tenth person and first woman to be given that honor. In 1993 she was inducted into the Oklahoma Women\'s Hall of Fame. [7]\n\nIn 2014, NASA announced her selection to the United States Astronaut Hall of Fame.
